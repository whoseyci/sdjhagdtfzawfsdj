## Introduction

**Summary:** The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) represents the EU's largest budget program, with Spain receiving substantial funding that heavily benefits Andalusia's dominant olive sector. Despite multiple reform waves aimed at improving environmental outcomes, evidence suggests limited success in achieving meaningful ecological improvements. (LLM Memory)

The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) constitutes the European Union's most significant financial commitment, accounting for approximately 40% of the total EU budget and distributing billions of euros annually to member states . Spain ranks among the largest CAP beneficiaries, with Andalusia receiving a disproportionate share of these funds due to its extensive agricultural sector, particularly olive cultivation which covers over 1.5 million hectares in the region . The olive sector's economic importance extends beyond agriculture, supporting rural communities and representing a cornerstone of Andalusian identity and economy . However, intensive olive farming practices supported by CAP subsidies have raised significant environmental concerns, including soil erosion, biodiversity loss, and water resource depletion . The EU has responded with successive CAP reforms in 1992, 2003, 2013, and 2023, each introducing increasingly sophisticated environmental requirements and "greening" measures designed to balance agricultural productivity with ecological sustainability . Yet mounting evidence suggests these reforms have achieved limited environmental improvements, with adoption rates of sustainable practices remaining low and environmental degradation continuing in many olive-growing areas .

## CAP Budget and Funding in Andalusia's Olive Sector

**Summary:** The EU allocates approximately 2.25 billion euros specifically to olive grove subsidies through the CAP, with Andalusia capturing the majority of these funds due to its 1.5 million hectares of olive cultivation representing over 80% of Spain's production. Post-2003 reforms transformed these payments into largely decoupled area-based subsidies, allowing farmers to receive up to 95% of historical payment levels regardless of production outcomes.

The scale of CAP funding dedicated to olive cultivation is substantial, with the European Union allocating approximately 2.25 billion euros specifically to olive grove subsidies [(Torres et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2012103-562-11) [(Santilli et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2011.6.S1.E15). Andalusia captures the lion's share of this funding due to its dominant position in European olive production, hosting 1.5 million hectares of the 2.4 million hectares of olive groves registered in Spain, which accounts for over 80% of the country's olive production [(Torres et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2012103-562-11). The structure of these payments underwent significant transformation following CAP reforms, with olive grove owners now entitled to receive up to 95% of subsidies from the base period as area payments that are almost entirely decoupled from production type or level [(Santilli et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2011.6.S1.E15). The European Commission strategically selected reference years from 1999/00 to 2002/03 for calculating these payments, choosing the period that displayed the highest levels of both payments and production to establish the subsidy baseline [(Santilli et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2011.6.S1.E15). This decoupling mechanism was designed to reduce distortions in resource allocation while maintaining income support for olive producers across the EU's estimated 757 million olive trees spanning 5.44 million hectares [(Santilli et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2011.6.S1.E15).

## History of CAP Reforms and Implementation in Spain

**Summary:** The CAP underwent major reforms in 1992 (McSharry), 2003 (decoupling), 2013 (greening), with Spain joining in 1986 and implementing changes with delays. These reforms transformed olive subsidies from production-coupled payments to area-based support while introducing environmental requirements, but led to 25% expansion of Spanish olive groves and associated environmental problems. (5 sources)

Spain's integration into the Common Agricultural Policy began with EU accession in 1986, fundamentally transforming the country's olive sector by granting coupled subsidies that made olive farming more profitable than other agricultural activities [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12114398). The first major CAP reform came with the McSharry reform in 1992, which introduced a direct aid system to farmers alongside the original production targets that had defined the CAP since 1957 [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10110509). This period coincided with Andalusia facing drought conditions while receiving EU incentives to increase yields, leading to joint Research and Development programs between the Andalusian government and private olive producers that developed drip irrigation and fertirrigation systems, driving productivity increases and sector expansion throughout Spain [(Neves et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18335/REGION.V5I1.219). The 2003 reform marked a pivotal shift by decoupling subsidy payments from production and incorporating multiple direct payments into a single payment system, requiring farmers to meet land management standards and food safety, environmental, animal health and welfare targets [(Leeuwen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2019.01.018). Spain implemented these decoupled measures in 2006, three years after the reform's introduction [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10110509). The 2013 reform covering 2014-2020 introduced the "greening" of single payments, providing funds to farms using sustainable practices and maintaining ecologically rich landscapes [(Leeuwen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2019.01.018). This reform restructured the single payment into three components: basic payment scheme (56%), greening (30%), and payments for young farmers (2%), while increasing decoupled aid from 10% to 12% of the CAP budget [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10110509) [(Nazzaro et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1186/S40100-016-0060-Y). Despite theoretical benefits of greater stability and support, these reforms created competitive pressures that particularly affected small producers, who struggled to adapt to new animal welfare and food quality regulations while remaining competitive with larger enterprises [(Leeuwen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2019.01.018). The cumulative effect of CAP incentives led Spain to increase its olive grove area by 25% between 1990 and 2020 and double olive oil production, but this expansion into areas with steep slopes and high soil erodibility has exacerbated environmental problems including soil erosion [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12114398).

## Environmental Impact and Effectiveness of CAP Reforms

**Summary:** Comprehensive EU-wide studies demonstrate that CAP greening measures introduced in 2013 have produced limited environmental improvements, with small changes in land use, nutrient management, and biodiversity indicators. Despite multiple reforms aimed at environmental protection, recent assessments conclude the CAP remains primarily focused on production maximization rather than addressing climate and environmental challenges. (5 sources)

The most comprehensive assessment of CAP environmental effectiveness comes from EU-wide farm-level modeling, which found that greening measures introduced by the 2013 CAP reform produced relatively small land use effects, indicating that environmental impacts are rather limited and suggesting the policy will not contribute much to improving the CAP's provision of public goods [(Louhichi et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ERAE/JBX029). These findings align with multiple studies that documented only small changes in environmental indicators in response to CAP greening, including minimal improvements in nutrient surpluses, crop diversity, erosion control, and greenhouse gas emissions [(Louhichi et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ERAE/JBX029). Specific analysis of greening requirements reveals fundamental implementation flaws that undermine environmental objectives. The crop diversification requirement, designed as a key instrument for improving soil quality, had little influence because it affected only a small proportion of land and did not require adoption of crop rotation practices [(Diaz-Poblete et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13105705). While greening measures did contribute to some lasting changes in farmers' practices regarding nitrogen-fixing crops, few effects were found regarding maintenance of crop residues, fertilization, and compost application [(Diaz-Poblete et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13105705). These limited impacts led researchers to question greening's efficiency for meeting environmental goals and conclude it does not provide a sound precedent for building the new green architecture of the CAP [(Diaz-Poblete et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13105705). The environmental consequences of CAP-incentivized expansion in Spain's olive sector illustrate the policy's failure to prevent ecological degradation. CAP subsidies encouraged a 25% increase in olive grove area between 1990 and 2020, with expansion occurring particularly in areas with steep slopes, extreme rainfall, and high soil erodibility, significantly worsening erosion problems [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12114398). Recent studies conclude that despite numerous legislative reforms, the CAP approach still appears oriented toward maximizing agricultural production and supporting farmer incomes rather than addressing environmental priorities [(Gottero, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su132313062). Furthermore, the CAP does not appear well equipped to respond to new environmental and climate challenges, with multiple assessments indicating the policy has not been very effective in achieving environmental and landscape priorities [(Gottero, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su132313062) [(Seidl et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1080/01426397.2018.1503237).

## Adoption Rates and Implementation Challenges

**Summary:** CAP reforms created uneven adoption patterns, with greening measures affecting only small proportions of farmland and showing limited influence on key practices like crop rotation. While organic olive farming has expanded due to CAP incentives, small producers struggled to adapt to new regulations, leading to widespread land abandonment across rural Spain. (3 sources)

The implementation of CAP reforms revealed significant challenges in achieving widespread adoption of environmental practices. The crop diversification requirement, designed as a key instrument for improving soil quality, had little influence because it affected only a small proportion of land and did not require adoption of crop rotation practices [(Diaz-Poblete et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13105705). While greening measures contributed to some lasting changes in farmers' practices regarding nitrogen-fixing crops, few effects were found regarding maintenance of crop residues, fertilization, and compost application [(Diaz-Poblete et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13105705). The differential impact of reforms became particularly evident among farm sizes and types. Small producers faced difficulties adapting to new animal welfare and food quality regulations while staying competitive with larger enterprises, eventually leading to land abandonment as it was no longer economically beneficial to stay in business [(Leeuwen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2019.01.018). This challenge manifested across rural Spain, with an annual decline in utilized agricultural area of 0.7% for arable land and 1.3% for pastures between 1973 and 2005, affecting 32.5% of the total Spanish territory during 1989-1999 [(Leeuwen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2019.01.018). However, certain sectors showed more positive adoption patterns. The expansion of organic olive groves occurred mainly due to changes in the CAP, together with farmers' and society's demands, as the current CAP no longer shapes policy based on subsidies directly proportional to production, instead encouraging adoption of agricultural practices aimed at maximizing crop sustainability and rural development [(Sousa et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13147983). Despite these selective successes, overall assessment indicates that greening had limited impact, questioning its efficiency for meeting environmental goals and suggesting it does not provide a sound precedent for building the new green architecture of the CAP [(Diaz-Poblete et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13105705).
