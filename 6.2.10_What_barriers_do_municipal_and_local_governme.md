**Research Query:** 6.2.10 What barriers do municipal and local governments face in implementing national and EU agricultural and environmental policies in Spain?

---

## Introduction

**Summary:** Municipal and local governments in Spain face significant barriers when implementing national and EU agricultural and environmental policies due to complex multi-level governance structures and limited resources. These challenges create gaps between policy goals set at higher levels and actual implementation on the ground. (LLM Memory)

Spanish municipal and local governments operate within a complex multi-level governance system where they must implement agricultural and environmental policies designed at both national and European Union levels. This creates inherent tensions as local authorities often lack the autonomy, resources, and technical capacity needed to effectively translate broad policy frameworks into practical local action . The implementation gap becomes particularly pronounced in agricultural and environmental sectors, where policies must be adapted to diverse local contexts including varying geographic conditions, economic structures, and stakeholder needs across Spain's different regions . Local governments frequently find themselves caught between top-down policy mandates and bottom-up community demands, struggling to balance compliance requirements with local priorities and constraints . These implementation challenges are further complicated by Spain's decentralized governance structure, where regional autonomous communities also play significant roles in policy interpretation and delivery, creating additional layers of coordination complexity for municipal authorities .

## Institutional and Governance Structure Barriers

**Summary:** Spain's complex multi-level governance system creates significant institutional barriers for local governments implementing agricultural and environmental policies. Too many overlapping institutions with unclear roles and poor coordination between different administrative levels and policy areas make effective implementation difficult. (3 sources)

The most significant institutional barrier facing Spanish municipalities is the overly complex organizational structure of institutions responsible for policy implementation. Spain suffers from too many institutions involved in water and environmental management at national, regional, and local levels, which causes roles and responsibilities to be unclear and sometimes overlapping [(Campling et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142971). This creates a definite dispersion of competencies and large variability in how stakeholders perceive the governance structure, which confuses farmers and discourages them from contacting specific authorities [(Campling et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142971). The fragmented distribution of competencies between different governmental levels severely limits municipal capacity for action. In Spain's decentralized system, most political competencies and budgetary resources for agri-food, health, environmental, and rural development policies rely on regional and national administrations, leaving municipalities with only residual roles [(Molina-Holgado et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land9110462) [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399746). This fragmentation of competencies and frequent changes in governmental structure acts as a major constraint, with resources not being channeled well because different regional departments work in segregated spheres rather than collaboratively [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399746). Poor coordination between different policy areas creates additional implementation challenges. Regulations from groundwater, surface water, drinking water, agriculture, and nature conservation are poorly coordinated, with different governmental departments focusing only on their own interests [(Campling et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142971). This creates situations where finding practical solutions at the local level becomes very difficult, as requirements from one regulation often contradict requirements from another [(Campling et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142971). The lack of cooperation and communication between stakeholders at the local level further inhibits the effectiveness of policy measures [(Campling et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142971).

## Policy Coordination and Integration Challenges

**Summary:** Spanish municipalities struggle with poor coordination between different policy areas and administrative levels, creating contradictory requirements that make local implementation extremely difficult. The lack of integrated planning frameworks and sectoral approaches to policy development further complicate efforts to find practical solutions at the local level. (4 sources)

One of the most critical challenges facing Spanish municipalities is the poor coordination between different policy areas that affect agricultural and environmental implementation. Regulations from groundwater, surface water, drinking water, agriculture, and nature conservation are poorly coordinated, with different governmental departments focusing only on their own interests [(Campling et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142971). This creates situations where finding practical solutions at the local level becomes very difficult, as requirements from one regulation often contradict requirements from another [(Campling et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142971). The sectoral planning approach creates additional integration problems that municipalities must navigate. The legal framework makes it difficult to integrate unconventional resources into management systems, which is a result of sectoral planning of large infrastructures through plans that facilitated investment but did not overcome legal obstacles or correctly identify potential users [(Sanchis-Ibor et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE11040317). Without a national strategy involving legal reforms to integrate non-conventional resources and establish fairer distribution of economic and environmental burdens between agricultural and urban users, regional governments end up financing expensive local solutions to overcome existing legal difficulties [(Sanchis-Ibor et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE11040317). Municipal governments also face significant internal coordination challenges that limit their effectiveness. Most municipalities report very little internal collaboration between departments within each municipality, with significant administrative difficulties arising from specific administrative and accountability roles [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399746). Only a few municipalities have departments explicitly oriented towards agriculture, with most promoting agri-food policies through the limited resources of departments such as environment, education, waste, and climate change [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399746). At the local level, the effectiveness of regional measures is reduced by scheme factors including the lack of policy coordination and competition from other CAP financial measures, as well as attitudinal factors like skepticism from farmers and reluctance from agricultural authorities [(Mazorra, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3989/egeogr.2000.i239.532).

## Resource and Capacity Constraints

**Summary:** Spanish municipalities face severe resource limitations with most relying solely on their own personnel and budgets to implement agricultural and environmental policies. The concentration of political competencies and resources at regional and national levels leaves local governments with limited access to funding and administrative capacity. (1 source)

Spanish municipalities operate with severely constrained resources, as most of the resources employed by municipalities for implementing food and agricultural policies are solely municipal resources, both in personnel and budgetary terms [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399746). This limitation stems from Spain's governance structure where most political competencies and budgetary resources for agri-food, health, environmental, and rural development policies rely on both regional and national administrations [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399746). The lack of competencies creates two main constraints that directly limit municipal effectiveness: limited access to resources and reduced administrative and political capacity for action [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399746). This resource scarcity is particularly evident in staffing, where only a few municipalities have departments explicitly oriented towards agriculture, with most promoting agri-food policies through the limited resources of departments such as environment, education, waste, and climate change [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399746). Internal capacity constraints further limit municipal effectiveness. Most municipalities report very little internal collaboration between departments, creating significant administrative difficulties that are compounded by specific administrative and accountability roles [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399746). The lack of political competencies can even be used as an argument by civil servants to place obstacles in front of innovative approaches to local food policies, while ideological biases and lack of information in technical staff may also introduce implementation obstacles [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399746). Perhaps most telling is that municipal policymakers expect little to no support from supra-municipal administrations, with the regional government and EU sometimes cited by interviewees but the national administration hardly ever mentioned as a source of assistance [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399746). This isolation forces municipalities to call for better cooperation and coordination between different administrative levels, with interviewees expressing that "there has to be teamwork" and noting that resources are not channeled well because different regional departments work in segregated spheres [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399746).

## Bureaucratic and Administrative Barriers

**Summary:** Spanish municipalities face excessive bureaucracy and complex administrative processes that create significant barriers to implementing agricultural and environmental policies. Overly strict regulations, demanding licensing procedures, and complex policy designs make it difficult for local governments to effectively deliver programs to farmers and other stakeholders. (5 sources)

The implementation barriers facing Spanish municipalities include several key bureaucratic and administrative challenges: • **Excessive bureaucracy in policy design**: The design and implementation of agricultural policies suffer from inadequate design of CAP aid and the bureaucracy associated with it, creating serious obstacles for local implementation [(Morales-Jerrett et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12031181). Greater bureaucracy and rigidities, often associated with large and complex national administrations, reduce implementation of government procurement policies at the municipal level [(Shadrina et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2022.107458). • **Complex and demanding application processes**: The implementation of agricultural measures is very complex and needs to be reviewed to make them more 'friendly' to producers, especially in terms of reducing bureaucracy so that farmers can be "near their land rather than filling in papers" [(Brown et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.105136). • **Overly strict regulatory standards**: Municipal efforts face constraints from overly strict legislative water quality standards together with demanding licensing processes that slow down municipal efforts to reuse treated wastewater [(Steflova et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W10060739). The legislative framework tends to be overly precautious, which does not reflect nor support the ambitions and efforts of local stakeholders aiming to implement innovation [(Steflova et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W10060739). • **Lack of policy coordination creating administrative complexity**: At the local level, the effectiveness of regional measures is reduced by scheme factors including the lack of policy coordination and competition from other CAP financial measures, as well as attitudinal factors like skepticism from farmers and reluctance from agricultural authorities [(Mazorra, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3989/egeogr.2000.i239.532). • **Disconnection between policy evaluation and municipal experience**: Municipal experiences with water reuse and other innovations are not fully taken into account in the evaluation of regional and national policy, creating barriers to learning and improvement [(Steflova et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W10060739). • **Political instability affecting policy coherence**: Periodical shifts in political parties further impede the development of coherent policy that supports local implementation schemes [(Steflova et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W10060739).

## Implementation Challenges in Specific Policy Areas

**Summary:** Spanish municipalities face particular difficulties implementing EU environmental policies, with challenges ranging from wetland management conflicts to inadequate agricultural support systems. Water reuse programs and livestock policies show especially problematic implementation gaps between EU goals and local realities. (5 sources)

Spanish municipalities encounter significant sector-specific implementation challenges that highlight the broader systemic problems in translating EU and national policies into local action. Spain has shown notable difficulties and deficiencies when implementing EU policies, particularly in the emblematic case of environmental policy [(Legnani, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.5565/rev/quadernsiee.68). **Environmental and Wetland Management**: Local governments face complex conflicts in managing sensitive ecosystems where human impacts create competing land use pressures. The high degree of human impact on wetland ecosystems is one of the factors hindering the implementation of plans for sustainable use and management, with municipalities struggling to balance altered hydroperiods, impaired water quality, land use changes, and urban development pressures from roads and golf courses [(Sebastia-Frasquet et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W6030620). Even when legal frameworks exist, their practical effectiveness remains debatable, often requiring municipalities to develop multiple strategies when initial plans prove insufficient [(Sebastia-Frasquet et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W6030620). **Water Reuse and Quality Standards**: Municipal water management efforts face significant regulatory barriers that slow implementation of innovative solutions. Overly strict legislative water quality standards together with demanding licensing processes slow down Spanish municipal efforts to reuse treated wastewater, with the legislative framework being overly precautious and not reflecting or supporting local stakeholder ambitions to implement innovation [(Steflova et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W10060739). Municipal experiences with water reuse are not fully taken into account in the evaluation of regional and national policy, while periodical shifts in political parties further impede the development of coherent policy that supports water-reuse schemes [(Steflova et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W10060739). **Agricultural Policy Implementation**: The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) implementation creates particular challenges for extensive livestock systems and traditional land management practices. Agricultural policies were mainly designed to address environmental problems faced by intensive farms, whereas the design and implementation of policies responding to the needs of extensive livestock farms were given much less weight [(Morales-Jerrett et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12031181). The inadequate design of CAP aid and associated bureaucracy, combined with difficulties in meeting environmental commitments and corresponding penalties, create serious implementation problems for municipalities supporting local farmers [(Morales-Jerrett et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12031181). **Conservation Funding Gaps**: Traditional land management systems face implementation barriers due to political resistance and inadequate funding mechanisms. The paralysis in agreed compensations for dehesa regeneration management relates to prejudice in certain political groups not favoring public spending on compensations to large landowners for biophysical resource restoration [(Campos et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104984). European Union territorial contracts provide alternative funding avenues, but have not been implemented by the Spanish government and autonomous communities with the vigor that usually accompanies new environmental policy design [(Campos et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104984).

## Stakeholder Engagement and Participation Issues

**Summary:** Spanish municipalities struggle with inadequate public participation mechanisms and poor stakeholder communication, which creates barriers to effective policy implementation. The complex institutional structure discourages farmer engagement while excluding important voices from decision-making processes. (3 sources)

Spanish local governments face significant challenges in engaging stakeholders effectively during agricultural and environmental policy implementation. The public administration has not developed an effective method by which to fulfill the obligation to include active public participation [(Castro et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16214097). This failure to establish proper participation mechanisms creates a fundamental barrier to successful policy implementation at the municipal level. The complex organizational structure of institutions creates additional stakeholder engagement problems that directly impact policy effectiveness. There are too many institutions involved in water management at national and regional/local levels, which causes roles and responsibilities to be unclear and sometimes overlapping, creating a definite dispersion of competencies and large variability in stakeholders' perception of the governance structure [(Campling et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142971). This confusion discourages farmers from contacting specific authorities and inhibits uptake of measures, while also meaning that the voices of some stakeholders are not heard by others and that actions taken by government officials favor specific groups of stakeholders [(Campling et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142971). The lack of cooperation and communication between stakeholders at the local level further compounds implementation difficulties. There is not only little integrated effort in defining and implementing measures, but also a lack of communication and exchange of information between different stakeholder groups [(Campling et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142971). This creates situations where finding practical solutions at the local level becomes very difficult, as different stakeholders operate in isolation rather than working collaboratively toward common goals. To address these engagement challenges, experts have called for more participatory approaches in natural resource management and planning, as well as governance forms that facilitate cooperation among resource managers and broader stakeholders [(Plieninger et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-12647-260323). However, municipal governments continue to struggle with implementing these participatory approaches within the constraints of existing institutional frameworks and limited resources.
