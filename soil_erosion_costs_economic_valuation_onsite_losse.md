## Introduction and Background

**Summary:** Soil erosion causes significant economic losses through both on-site effects (like reduced crop yields and nutrient depletion) and off-site effects (like infrastructure damage from sediment). These costs can be measured at farm, regional, or national levels but are often unevenly distributed across society. (4 sources)

Soil erosion represents one of the most significant environmental and economic challenges facing global agriculture and land management. The economic costs of soil erosion can be understood as the loss of ecosystem services, particularly erosion control, though erosion also negatively affects multiple soil-based ecosystem services simultaneously [(Bartkowski et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8749). These economic losses can be assessed at multiple scales, from individual farm operations to catchment levels and even national assessments [(Istanbuly et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042372). The economic impacts of soil erosion are typically categorized into two main types: on-site and off-site costs. On-site effects occur directly where soil is removed and include nutrient losses, reduced agricultural yields, land depletion, and biological losses [(Istanbuly et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042372) [(Borrelli et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-02142-7). These costs are often internalized by land users through increased fertilizer use, water management practices, or reduced productivity. In contrast, off-site costs affect surrounding areas through sedimentation, siltation, eutrophication, and flooding, but these external costs are typically borne by society rather than the land users who cause the erosion [(Borrelli et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-02142-7). This unequal distribution of costs creates significant economic challenges, particularly in developing countries where farmers may lack resources to compensate for productivity losses through additional inputs [(Borrelli et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-02142-7) [(Breetzke et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.5772/52314). The resulting decline in soil productivity can force agricultural workers to migrate to urban areas, further burdening national economies [(Breetzke et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.5772/52314).

## On-site Economic Impacts

**Summary:** On-site erosion costs include direct productivity losses from reduced crop yields and increased production expenses to maintain farming operations. These costs are measured through nutrient replacement values and lost agricultural output, with estimates ranging from tens to hundreds of dollars per hectare annually. (12 sources)

On-site economic impacts of soil erosion affect farmers directly through two primary mechanisms: reduced land fertility that decreases crop productivity, and increased production costs required to maintain agricultural output levels [(Leyva et al., 2007)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2007053-246). These production cost increases may result from more expensive current agricultural practices or the need for new conservation and soil amendment practices, ultimately leading to land rent losses and productive capital losses that can reduce the market value of eroded land [(Leyva et al., 2007)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2007053-246). The most commonly used method for quantifying on-site costs is the replacement cost approach, which calculates the monetary value of nutrients lost through erosion based on the cost of synthetic fertilizers needed to replace them [(Telles et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1590/S0103-90162013000300010) [(Kabirigi et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.18006/2017.5(4).525.536). Studies using this method have found substantial variation in costs. For example, research in Ghana found seasonal costs of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium losses ranging from US$ 7.1 per hectare under conservation tillage to much higher amounts under excessive tillage practices [(Bashagaluke et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0208250) [(Quansah et al., 2000)](https://doi.org/10.4314/GJAS.V33I1.1882). In Turkey, average economic losses were estimated at USD 59.54 per hectare per year in pasture lands and USD 102.36 in agricultural lands [(Lee et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/app14051811). Agricultural productivity losses represent another major component of on-site costs. In the European Union, the 12 million hectares of agricultural areas suffering from severe erosion lose approximately 0.43% of their crop productivity annually, resulting in estimated costs of around €1.25 billion per year [(Panagos et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1002/ldr.2879) [(Panagos et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1002/gch2.202400336). Similarly, in Albania, wheat and maize yield losses due to soil degradation were calculated at US$ 40.2 million annually, while nutrient losses added another US$ 98 million, totaling approximately 5.5% of the country's agricultural GDP [(Binaj et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.17221/12/2013-AGRICECON). The scale of on-site impacts varies significantly by region and crop type. In Canada, soil erosion costs from yield losses over 44 years leading up to 2015 totaled CAD 33.51 billion, with oilseeds, small grains, and potatoes being the most affected crops [(Badreldin et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su15054489). Globally, estimates suggest that land degradation costs between 2.9% and 6.3% of agricultural gross domestic product, with annual soil losses of 75 billion tons costing approximately US$ 4000 billion per year worldwide [(Solangi et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c00823) [(Samuel et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.31220/osf.io/zvja9).

## Off-site Economic Impacts

**Summary:** Off-site erosion costs affect society beyond the eroded land through sedimentation that damages infrastructure, reduces reservoir capacity, and degrades water quality. These costs include water treatment expenses, hydropower losses, and flood damage, with global estimates reaching hundreds of billions annually. (8 sources)

Off-site economic impacts of soil erosion create external costs that are typically borne by society rather than the land users who cause the erosion [(Borrelli et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-02142-7). These impacts occur in surrounding areas through sedimentation, siltation, eutrophication, and flooding, affecting infrastructure and water resources far from the original erosion sites [(Telles et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1590/S0103-90162013000300010) [(Mandal et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xliii-b3-2020-137-2020). Reservoir sedimentation represents one of the most significant off-site costs, as sediment accumulation reduces hydroelectric power generation capacity and irrigation water supply [(Telles et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1590/S0103-90162013000300010). In the European Union, comprehensive assessments estimate sediment removal costs from catchments at approximately €2.5 billion annually due to water erosion alone [(Panagos et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1002/gch2.202400336). When considering all soil loss processes and extrapolating to the EU's approximately 5,000 large reservoirs, sediment accumulation exceeds 1 billion cubic meters with potential removal costs ranging between €5 and 8 billion annually [(Panagos et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1002/gch2.202400336). Regional examples demonstrate the substantial scale of off-site costs. On the island of Java, Indonesia, off-site costs from soil erosion were estimated at up to $75 million annually, including $2.7 million in annual hydropower losses due to reservoir sedimentation [(Zorn et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.21861/HGG.2011.73.02.02). These off-site consequences include sedimentation that reduces river and drainage capacity, enhances flood risks, blocks irrigation canals, and shortens the design life of reservoirs and hydroelectricity projects [(Mandal et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xliii-b3-2020-137-2020). Water quality degradation adds another major component of off-site costs. Erosion transports nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, into water bodies, causing eutrophication and increasing water treatment costs [(Mandal et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xliii-b3-2020-137-2020) [(Telles et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1590/S0103-90162013000300010). In the EU, current phosphorus displacement due to erosion totals approximately 374,000 tons, with about 97,000 tons ending up in river basins and sea outlets [(Panagos et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1002/gch2.202400336). The geographic distribution of off-site costs creates inequities, as economic impacts are often larger near metropolitan areas compared to remote rural regions, even under similar erosion intensities [(Wang et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU70810308). Globally, wind erosion alone causes an estimated $400 billion per year in economic losses through both on-site and off-site consequences [(Gholami et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-70125-y). Economic assessments that include both on-site and off-site impacts estimate total erosion costs at approximately $16.7 per ton of soil lost (adjusted for 2022 inflation) [(Zhang et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-99218-y).

## Valuation Methods and Approaches

**Summary:** Economists use several methods to value soil erosion damage, with replacement cost (calculating fertilizer costs to replace lost nutrients) and productivity loss approaches being most common. However, different valuation methods can produce estimates that vary by up to ten-fold, creating challenges for reliable economic assessments. (10 sources)

The economic valuation of soil erosion damage relies on several established methodological approaches, each with distinct advantages and limitations. The most widely used approach is the replacement cost method, which calculates the monetary value of nutrients lost through erosion based on the cost of synthetic fertilizers needed to replace them [(Kabirigi et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.18006/2017.5(4).525.536) [(Pugliesi et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.1590/S0006-87052011000100017) [(Telles et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1590/S0103-90162013000300010). This method typically focuses on macronutrients including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, using market prices for commercial fertilizers plus application costs [(Telles et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1590/S0103-90162013000300010). A second major approach estimates economic costs through productivity losses, assessing the effect of topsoil losses on agricultural production in terms of decreased crop yields or diminished pasture capacity [(Baveye et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2016.00041). This production method can include calculations based on lost yield, reduced profits, and in severe cases, drops in land values [(Telles et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1590/S0103-90162013000300010). More comprehensive valuation frameworks attempt to capture both on-site and off-site damages. The suggested damage cost approach includes on-site impacts such as loss of nutrients, reduced harvests, and reduced land value, alongside off-site damages including silting of waterways, flooding, and property damage [(Galgani et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.5772/24305). Advanced methodologies now incorporate additional cost components including soil carbon emissions, sediment delivery, and dust production, combining biophysical quantities with market prices for fertilizers, carbon emissions, and cleaning costs [(Zong et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024EF005287) [(Jang et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EF001641). However, significant methodological challenges exist in erosion cost assessment. Different valuation approaches can produce estimates that vary by up to ten-fold, which reduces the credibility of assessments for decision-making purposes [(Achasova, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.26565/1992-4259-2020-22-01) [(2020)](https://doi.org/10.26565/1992-4259-2020-22-01). For practical applications at the land user level, the most reliable quantification methods focus on agricultural product shortages and losses of soil organic matter and fertilizers [(Achasova, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.26565/1992-4259-2020-22-01) [(2020)](https://doi.org/10.26565/1992-4259-2020-22-01). Comprehensive case studies demonstrate how multiple valuation components can be integrated. Research in Ethiopia analyzed erosion costs by combining yield loss calculations, soil rehabilitation cost-benefit analysis, personnel and material costs, and nutrient monetization based on fertilizer prices, with results showing damage costs of US$ 4,896, rehabilitation costs of US$ 24,480, and nutrient replacement costs of US$ 28,320 for four erosion events [(Kuhn et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-023-05874-6).

## Regional and Global Cost Estimates

**Summary:** Soil erosion costs vary dramatically by region, from hundreds of dollars per hectare in some areas to billions in national losses. Global estimates suggest soil erosion costs approximately $4000 billion annually worldwide, with significant regional variation based on erosion rates and economic conditions. (12 sources)

**Global Estimates:** - Worldwide annual soil loss of 75 billion tons costs approximately US$ 4000 billion per year, or about US$ 70 per person annually [(Samuel et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.31220/osf.io/zvja9) - Global economic losses from soil erosion are estimated at around $8 billion due to reduced soil fertility, decreased crop yields, and increased water usage [(Arrington, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.35410/ijaeb.2021.5696) **Regional South Asia:** - Annual production losses are estimated at 36 million tons of cereal equivalent valued at US$ 54,000 million from water erosion and US$ 1800 million from wind erosion [(Samuel et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.31220/osf.io/zvja9) - South Asia loses $10 billion annually from soil erosion [(Arrington, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.35410/ijaeb.2021.5696) **European Union:** - Annual costs of soil erosion range from €0.7 to 14 billion across EU member states [(Steinhoff-Knopp et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08814-0) - The 12 million hectares suffering severe erosion lose approximately €1.25 billion annually in agricultural productivity [(Panagos et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1002/ldr.2879) [(Steinhoff-Knopp et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08814-0) - European countries face $1.38 billion in annual agricultural productivity losses and $171 million in lost GDP [(Arrington, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.35410/ijaeb.2021.5696) **North America:** - Canada's soil erosion costs from yield losses over 44 years leading to 2015 totaled CAD 33.51 billion, with oilseeds, small grains, and potatoes being most affected [(Badreldin et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su15054489) - The U.S. agricultural sector loses about $44 billion per year from erosion, including $100 million in lost farm income [(Arrington, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.35410/ijaeb.2021.5696) - In the U.S. Midwest, increased soil erosion from grassland conversion costs $169 million annually [(Zhang et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abecbe) **Country-Specific Examples:** - **Indonesia (Java):** On-site costs were approximately $327 million in 1985 (4% of total dryland crop value), with off-site costs reaching $75 million annually and hydropower losses of $2.7 million [(Zorn et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.21861/HGG.2011.73.02.02) - **Philippines:** On-site erosion damage was around $50.10/ha in nominal prices and $127.50/ha in shadow prices [(Zorn et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.21861/HGG.2011.73.02.02) - **Albania:** Economic losses total US$ 138.2 million per year (about 5.5% of agricultural GDP), with wheat and maize yield losses at US$ 40.2 million and nutrient losses at US$ 98 million [(Binaj et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.17221/12/2013-AGRICECON) - **Indonesia (Pekalongan Regency):** Forest erosion prevention services valued at IDR 1,994,020,000/year for 28,486 hectares of forest area [(Harini et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/683/1/012092) **Site-Specific Studies:** - Spanish almond plantations: €27.16 per hectare per year [(Leijster et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2020.102878) - Italian vineyards: €1575 per hectare per year due to 10-fold higher erosion rates [(Leijster et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2020.102878) - Italian watershed study: Agricultural crop productivity values ranging from EUR 0 to 35,320.50 per hectare depending on land use [(Romanazzi et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13091512) - Small erosion channels in Nigeria: Nutrient losses cost between $305 and $5698 per site, with gross costs reaching $19,377 over two years [(Tekwa et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.100477)

## Challenges in Quantification

**Summary:** Quantifying soil erosion costs faces major methodological challenges, with different approaches producing estimates that vary by up to ten-fold. The complexity of measuring both direct and indirect impacts, along with limited data availability, makes reliable economic assessment difficult for decision-making. (6 sources)

The economic quantification of soil erosion damage faces significant methodological and practical challenges that limit the reliability and comparability of cost estimates. The most fundamental issue is the substantial variation between different valuation approaches, with different assessment methods producing estimates that can differ by up to ten-fold, which reduces the credibility of these assessments when making decisions [(Achasova, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.26565/1992-4259-2020-22-01) [(2020)](https://doi.org/10.26565/1992-4259-2020-22-01). This wide range of estimates creates uncertainty for policymakers and land managers attempting to justify conservation investments or erosion control measures. The complexity of measuring soil erosion costs stems from the need to capture both direct and indirect impacts that may be difficult to quantify [(Suzuki et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems8020045). While studies often focus on easily measured components like nutrient replacement costs, the real cost of soil erosion extends far beyond these basic calculations to include factors such as fuel costs, fertilizer transportation expenses, land depreciation, and broader environmental impacts [(Suzuki et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems8020045). This complexity is compounded by the challenge of incorporating off-site costs, as few studies successfully include these external impacts despite their potentially significant economic importance [(Baveye et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2016.00041) [(Telles et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1590/S0103-90162013000300010). Data limitations present another major obstacle to accurate cost quantification. Limited data and information availability on economic losses from erosion hampers comprehensive assessment and valuation efforts [(Baveye et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2016.00041) [(Telles et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1590/S0103-90162013000300010). This data scarcity contributes to the wide uncertainty in global cost estimates, which range from $4 billion to $490 billion for degraded land impacts [(Solangi et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c00823). For practical applications, these challenges mean that reliable quantification methods must focus on the most measurable and relevant impacts. At the land user level, the most dependable approach for quantifying potential erosion damage focuses on agricultural product shortages and losses of soil organic matter and fertilizers [(Achasova, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.26565/1992-4259-2020-22-01) [(2020)](https://doi.org/10.26565/1992-4259-2020-22-01). However, even with simplified approaches, soil erosion remains a complex source of environmental, social, and economic issues that represents a major challenge for food security and sustainable development [(Suzuki et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems8020045).
