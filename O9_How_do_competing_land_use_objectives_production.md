---

## Introduction: Competing Land Use Objectives

**Summary:** Farmers face a fundamental tension between maximizing production for economic survival and implementing conservation practices that may reduce short-term profitability. This conflict is intensified by policy systems that often send contradictory signals, encouraging both agricultural intensification and environmental protection simultaneously. (6 sources)

Farmers operate at the center of a complex tension between production-focused and conservation-oriented land use objectives that creates significant challenges for decision-making, particularly when profit margins are constrained. At the local scale, farmers are the primary decision makers of land they own and rent, with their first priority being biomass or food production, while conservation goals remain a secondary priority and most conservation decisions must consider opportunity costs [(Quinn et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-09132-220139) [(Seenivasan, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.33545/26179210.2021.v4.i1a.70). This fundamental hierarchy of priorities creates inherent conflicts when conservation technologies compete directly with profitable commercial activities for scarce land and labor resources, making farmers perceive these techniques as economically unattractive due to high opportunity costs [(Hilger et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-33377-4_7). The challenge is further complicated by policy systems that generate internal conflicts within agriculture-environment systems through competing land use incentives. Programs may simultaneously provide payments to encourage marginal cropland conversion to forest or grassland for soil erosion reduction while also offering direct subsidies to encourage grain production and improve agricultural productivity [(Yu et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10061776). This poorly coordinated policy approach creates a core conflict between land uses for conservation versus those required for agricultural production, particularly in contexts with scarce arable land and pressing food security concerns [(Yu et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10061776). The debate over how to manage these competing objectives has crystallized around "land sharing" versus "land sparing" approaches - either setting aside land specifically for conservation with intensive agriculture conducted separately, or sharing land across multiple goals from food production to biodiversity conservation through less intensive practices [(Lacerda et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land9060176) [(Fischer et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12084). However, a persistent disconnect remains between international agreements, national policies, and local grassroots initiatives, highlighting the need for integrated landscape approaches that can bridge competing social, ecological, economic, and political contexts through stakeholder engagement [(Lacerda et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land9060176).

## Economic Factors and Profit Considerations in Farmer Decision-Making

**Summary:** Economic factors fundamentally drive farmer decision-making, with financial viability taking priority over environmental considerations when the two compete. Farmers operating under tight profit margins are particularly likely to prioritize short-term economic returns over conservation investments, especially when conservation practices require foregone agricultural income or additional costs. (10 sources)

Economic considerations serve as the primary driver of farmer decision-making when balancing production and conservation objectives, with financial viability consistently outweighing environmental concerns when resources are constrained. Survey results indicate that low crop production performance in terms of meeting both household food needs and profit goals is the primary reason why households do not participate in conservation efforts and sustainable resource management practices [(Mellaku et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/RESOURCES7040076). This economic imperative is further reinforced by research showing that when environmental considerations are pitted against market and financial factors, agricultural land managers are likely to trade off environmental concerns [(Kwenye et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land12030532). The urgency of economic needs through intensively developed farming activities motivates farmers to make decisions based on short-term considerations, with socioeconomic factors and the continuation of farming operations serving as significant determinants in decision-making processes [(Sumaryanto et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land11101827). Financial factors related to profit, income, and expenses emerge as the most important considerations for farmers when making land-use change decisions, as businesses unable to make a profit cannot be successful in the long term, making all land-use decisions fundamentally dependent on sustaining or improving farm financial viability [(Uffelen et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.33584/jnzg.2023.85.3643). The economic calculus of conservation adoption follows clear profit-maximization principles, where farmers will only switch from agriculture to conservation when offered compensation equal to at minimum the agricultural rent forgone [(Simpson et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.13906). This decision-making framework means that agents maximize profits by choosing to enroll land parcels in conservation programs only where the marginal cost of enrollment (lost agricultural profit) is less than the payment offered [(Simpson et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106688). Consequently, farmers convert less profitable land to conservation first, with decisions influenced by soil types that affect crop productivity and opportunity costs [(Dziubanski et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2023.1020080). However, farmer strategies for managing these economic trade-offs vary significantly based on resource endowment and market orientation, with resource-endowed, market-oriented farmers more willing to invest in external inputs to increase profitability, while subsistence-focused farmers prioritize different considerations [(Ocimati et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11020311). The analysis confirms that farmers have multiple values and objectives beyond profit maximization, particularly among part-time and leisure-oriented farmers whose diverse objectives make the aspiration to achieve high production and income levels considerably less pronounced [(Brandle et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND4020475). Additionally, in settings where markets do not fully function, household production and investment decisions may not be dictated by profit considerations alone, but also by consumption choices, with factors such as household poverty characteristics and land tenure security playing critical roles in conservation investment decisions [(Bekele et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.5539/IJEF.V4N6P32).

## Trade-offs Between Production and Conservation Goals

**Summary:** Research reveals that trade-offs between production and conservation are not always inevitable, with some contexts showing that conservation policies can actually drive agricultural intensification and productivity gains. However, the specific outcomes depend heavily on farmer types, policy design, and external economic conditions like price shocks and subsidy structures. (7 sources)

The relationship between production and conservation goals presents complex dynamics that vary significantly based on policy implementation, farmer characteristics, and economic conditions. Contrary to assumptions of inevitable trade-offs, evidence from Brazil's Amazon demonstrates that conservation policies can actually enhance agricultural productivity when designed appropriately. Reductions in deforestation in priority municipalities were paired with increases in cattle production and productivity, consistent with a model where policy-induced decreases in the value of clearing new land cause credit-constrained farmers to shift investments from deforestation to capital investments in farming [(Koch et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ajae/aay110). This occurs because higher risks of punishment make illegal land expansion both more expensive and less valuable, inducing farmers in growing agricultural markets to reinvest in capital rather than land, leading to productivity gains through higher production per hectare [(Koch et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ajae/aay110). However, the success of balancing production and conservation depends heavily on farmer types and their underlying preferences. Implementation of intermediate-intensity silvopastoral systems by multifunctional landholders provided significant conservation gains with relatively small production losses, while productivist landholders showed strong inclination toward converting forests for pasture cultivation despite opportunities to increase conservation outcomes without significantly reducing productivity [(Mastrangelo et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-07186-200120). Realizing the potential of land-sharing scenarios requires transitions from productivist to multifunctional agricultural regimes, which may need exogenous incentives and regulations tailored to specific landholder behaviors [(Mastrangelo et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-07186-200120). Economic shocks and external income sources significantly influence how farmers navigate production-conservation trade-offs. Access to off-farm income reduces deforestation by providing alternative revenue streams, while agricultural subsidies break the dominance of pure forest conservation by enhancing the economic returns of sustainable intensification [(Knoke et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01133-y). Price volatility creates additional complexity, as farmers generally value cash crop monocultures more highly than diversified agroforestry systems, but crop and land use diversity become widely used strategies when facing price shocks [(Fleming et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2024.110915). The implementation of conservation practices faces practical barriers even when economically viable. Use-modifying mitigation options may require specific management skills and be perceived as riskier during adoption stages, while use-restricting options can compromise food security by increasing farmers' dependence on uncertain or expensive external purchases [(Borner et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.3390/F3030546). These challenges highlight how mitigation options could appear profitable based on standard opportunity cost analyses but remain unattractive under conditions that often prevail in forest environments [(Borner et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.3390/F3030546). Policy design plays a crucial role in shaping these trade-offs, with producers selecting different parts of their agricultural land mosaic for production versus other functions like wildlife habitat or watershed management, creating site-level management decisions that affect environmental conditions and feed back to production systems and profitability [(Spiegal et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aaa779). Effective policy approaches include removing production subsidies and implementing input taxes that allow farms to respond differently to the same policy, maintaining yields while potentially reducing resource consumption without additional land conversion [(Tanentzap et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002242).

## Farmer Types and Decision-Making Strategies

**Summary:** Different farmer types employ distinct decision-making strategies when balancing production and conservation goals, ranging from survivalist farmers focused on family security to market-oriented producers prioritizing profit maximization. These farmer categories demonstrate varying levels of willingness to adopt conservation practices based on their risk tolerance, resource endowment, and primary objectives. (5 sources)

Farmers can be categorized into distinct types that employ different strategies for navigating production-conservation trade-offs: • **Survivalist and Subsistence-Oriented Farmers**: These farmers prioritize family security over profit maximization, making them risk-averse rather than risk-takers [(Lopez-Carr, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land10111113). Hybrid commodity and subsistence farmers are typical on agricultural frontiers, where they tend to be cautious about replacing traditional production strategies with new ones that may offer higher potential yields but carry greater risk [(Lopez-Carr, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land10111113). Land allocation decisions differ across these farmer types based on their change orientation behaviors [(Eshetu et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/1747423X.2024.2386989). • **Market-Oriented Farmers**: These producers focus primarily on economic benefits and are more willing to transform land use when it provides clear financial returns [(Eshetu et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/1747423X.2024.2386989). However, their conservation participation varies significantly based on their relationship to markets and resource endowment levels. • **Multifunctional Landholders**: This farmer type demonstrates balanced preferences for both conservation and production outcomes, showing willingness to implement intermediate-intensity systems that provide conservation gains with relatively small production losses [(Mastrangelo et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-07186-200120). These farmers can achieve 30-50% more biodiversity benefits while experiencing only 10-15% yield reductions compared to high-intensity systems [(Mastrangelo et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-07186-200120). • **Productivist Landholders**: These farmers show clear inclination toward maximizing productivity through forest clearing and intensification, despite opportunities to increase conservation outcomes without significantly reducing production [(Mastrangelo et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-07186-200120). Promoting transitions away from purely productivist approaches requires exogenous incentives and regulations tailored to their specific behavior patterns [(Mastrangelo et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-07186-200120). • **Pre-Productivist Landholders**: This category shows potential for endogenous transition toward more sustainable practices, as they combine willingness to conserve forests with intentions to clear some portions and intensify land use [(Mastrangelo et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-07186-200120). These farmers can potentially increase productivity by 35-65% without compromising habitat quality [(Mastrangelo et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-07186-200120). The decision-making process for all farmer types involves a utility function that combines multiple factors including agricultural profit, intrinsic farmer attributes determined by type, social network influences, and spatial neighborhood effects [(Daloglu et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-06597-190312). Notably, poverty can drive deforestation among subsistence farmers, while successful frontier farmers tend to deforest more than their poorer neighbors [(Lopez-Carr, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land10111113) [(Munthali et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11030832).

## Policy and External Factors Influencing Land Use Decisions

**Summary:** Policy systems often create contradictory incentives that complicate farmer decision-making, simultaneously promoting both production intensification and conservation. External factors like off-farm income, subsidies, and regulatory uncertainty significantly influence how farmers balance competing land use objectives, with poorly coordinated policies generating internal conflicts in agriculture-environment systems. (7 sources)

Policy frameworks significantly shape farmer decision-making by creating both opportunities and barriers for balancing production and conservation objectives, though coordination failures often generate conflicting incentives that complicate land use choices. Programs may simultaneously provide payments to encourage marginal cropland conversion to forest or grassland to reduce soil erosion while appropriating direct subsidies to encourage grain production and improve agricultural productivity, creating internal conflicts in agriculture-environment systems where the core issue becomes competing land uses for conservation versus agricultural production [(Yu et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10061776). This poorly coordinated policy approach becomes particularly problematic in contexts with scarce arable land and pressing food security concerns, where conversion programs compete directly with production incentives [(Yu et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10061776). Access to external income sources and targeted financial incentives can significantly alter the production-conservation balance by reducing economic pressure on farmers to maximize land productivity. Off-farm income representing 30% of household income can save 4% of natural forest cover over a farmer's generation by providing alternative revenue streams that reduce deforestation pressure [(Knoke et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01133-y). Agricultural subsidies fundamentally change land use dynamics by breaking the dominance of pure forest conservation and enhancing the economic returns of sustainable intensification, though this demonstrates strong barriers to achieving sustainable intensification in practice [(Knoke et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01133-y). However, participation barriers remain substantial, particularly for small and medium-sized farmers who face complicated and costly requirements for accessing government payments and ecosystem service contracts. The scientific, legal, and management expertise required to negotiate and implement these arrangements creates significant obstacles even when programs could help farmers reduce risk exposure, increase profits, comply with environmental regulations, and enhance land quality [(Iles et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-05041-170442). Policy design significantly influences adoption patterns, with cost-sharing arrangements and tax incentives proving effective for promoting conservation practices like agroforestry systems. Investment costs and timber prices strongly affect farmer selection of conservation-oriented land uses, suggesting that targeted financial support can overcome adoption barriers, though labor-intensive practices may still face constraints on farms with acute labor shortages [(Gosling et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-021-01439-0). Regulatory uncertainty creates additional challenges for farmer decision-making, as many farmers feel unsure about the impact of current and future policy changes on their operations. This uncertainty generates hesitation to make sustainable land-use changes, with farmers concerned that decisions may not remain financially and strategically viable long-term if unsupported by stable regulations [(Uffelen et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.33584/jnzg.2023.85.3643). While farmers demonstrate high intrinsic environmental stewardship values, current environmental regulations primarily drive land-use decisions through extrinsic compliance requirements, potentially undermining farmers' existing conservation instincts [(Uffelen et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.33584/jnzg.2023.85.3643). Effective policy approaches focus on market-based mechanisms that allow differentiated responses across farm types rather than uniform standards. Removing production subsidies and implementing input taxes can maintain yields while reducing resource consumption without additional land conversion, as these policies enable some farmers to intensify production despite added costs while others find it profitable to reduce resource use [(Tanentzap et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002242). Multi-objective policy frameworks that consider multiple agricultural goals simultaneously show promise for addressing the current bias toward economic objectives at the expense of environmental quality [(Mellaku et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e08968).

## Barriers and Challenges to Balancing Objectives

**Summary:** Farmers face multiple practical barriers when trying to balance production and conservation objectives, including resource competition, labor constraints, technical complexity, and risk aversion. These challenges are particularly acute for smaller operations that lack the expertise and financial resources needed to navigate complex conservation programs while maintaining profitability. (6 sources)

Multiple structural and operational barriers prevent farmers from effectively balancing production and conservation objectives, creating persistent challenges even when conservation practices may be theoretically viable. Resource competition represents a fundamental constraint, as conservation technologies compete directly with main cropping activities for scarce land and labor resources, particularly when highly profitable commercial crops are involved, leading farmers to perceive these techniques as economically unattractive due to high opportunity costs [(Hilger et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-33377-4_7). This competition becomes especially pronounced when farmers face decreasing profit margins per unit of land and increasing competition for land among operators seeking to expand operations to maintain overall profitability [(Atwell et al., 2009)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-02787-140130). Technical and management complexity creates significant adoption barriers, particularly for conservation practices that require specialized skills and knowledge. Use-modifying conservation options typically require specific management skills and may be perceived as riskier during adoption stages, while use-restricting options can compromise food security by increasing farmers' dependence on uncertain or expensive external purchases of basic consumption items [(Borner et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.3390/F3030546). These management challenges mean that mitigation options could appear profitable based on standard opportunity cost analyses but remain unattractive under conditions that often prevail in agricultural environments. Access barriers particularly affect small and medium-sized farmers who face the most significant obstacles to participation in conservation programs. The complicated and costly scientific, legal, and management expertise required to negotiate and implement contracts for ecosystem services or access government payments creates strong barriers to participation, even when these programs could help farmers reduce risk exposure, increase profits, and comply with environmental regulations [(Iles et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-05041-170442). Labor constraints present additional operational challenges, with certain conservation practices requiring significantly more labor input than conventional approaches. Additional labor demand compared to conventional practices may prove an important barrier to adoption for farms facing acute labor shortages, though cost-sharing arrangements and tax incentives can help overcome financial barriers when investment costs and prices favor conservation-oriented land uses [(Gosling et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-021-01439-0). The complexity of balancing multiple objectives simultaneously creates ongoing decision-making challenges for farmers who must weigh income, time, ethics, and norms when making conservation decisions [(Atwell et al., 2009)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-02787-140130). Implementing new agricultural practices requires substantial time, effort, and risk tolerance, forcing farmers to prioritize among competing farm objectives while managing the inherent tension between maintaining profitability and achieving environmental outcomes [(Fidanova et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.15439/2022F10).
