**Research Query:** 6.2.5 What mechanisms exist for policy coordination between agricultural subsidies (CAP) and water management objectives in Spain?

---

## Background

**Summary:** Spain's agricultural sector relies heavily on EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidies while facing severe water scarcity issues that require careful coordination between farming support and water conservation goals. The need to balance agricultural productivity with sustainable water use has become critical as climate change intensifies drought conditions across Spanish regions. (LLM Memory)

Spain operates within the framework of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which provides substantial financial support to farmers through direct payments, rural development funds, and market intervention measures . The CAP represents one of the EU's largest budget items and significantly influences agricultural practices across Spain's diverse farming regions . At the same time, Spain faces acute water management challenges, with agriculture consuming approximately 70% of the country's available water resources . The country experiences irregular rainfall patterns, prolonged droughts, and increasing competition for water resources between agricultural, urban, and environmental uses . This dual reality creates a complex policy environment where agricultural subsidies must align with water conservation objectives to ensure long-term sustainability . The integration of these two policy domains has become increasingly important as climate change intensifies water scarcity and the EU pushes for more environmentally sustainable agricultural practices through CAP reforms .

## Current Coordination Mechanisms

**Summary:** The EU has established several mechanisms to coordinate CAP subsidies with water management objectives, including cross-compliance requirements that tie payments to environmental standards, Green Direct Payments for sustainable practices, and rural development funding specifically allocated for water-efficient technologies and infrastructure improvements.

The European Union has implemented multiple policy instruments to align agricultural subsidies with water management goals through the Common Agricultural Policy framework. The cross-compliance mechanism serves as the primary coordination tool, making CAP payments conditional on farmers' adherence to environmental regulations, including water protection standards and maintaining agricultural land in good environmental condition [(Venghaus et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/en12234446) [(Hristov et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.AGWAT.2021.106872). This mechanism directly ties financial support to environmental compliance, creating incentives for sustainable water use practices. The CAP's second pillar focuses on rural development and includes specific provisions for water management coordination. At least 30% of each rural development program's budget must be reserved for measures that benefit the environment and climate change mitigation, which are implemented through national or regional programs [(Venghaus et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/en12234446). These rural development measures specifically support investments in irrigation infrastructure improvements and more efficient irrigation techniques that reduce water losses [(Hristov et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.AGWAT.2021.106872). Additional coordination mechanisms include the Green Direct Payment system, which rewards farmers for implementing three key sustainable practices: maintaining permanent grassland, establishing ecological focus areas, and diversifying crops [(Venghaus et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/en12234446). The CAP also incorporates water metering as a management tool and can be complemented by other policy instruments such as water pricing schemes, environmental fees, and targeted taxes [(Guth et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.34659/eis.2024.89.2.738). These mechanisms work alongside the Water Framework Directive requirements, which seek to achieve good ecological status of water bodies through new hydrological planning approaches [(Gallego-Ayala et al., 2009)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2009071-395).

## Challenges and Limitations in Coordination

**Summary:** Despite progress in recent years, significant challenges remain in coordinating CAP subsidies with water management objectives, including fundamental conflicts between agricultural productivity goals and environmental protection, weakened policy linkages, and implementation gaps at the national level. (6 sources)

Despite advances in the last decade, the coordination of the CAP and water environmental policies still needs to be further improved to achieve a more sustainable use of water resources [(Garcia, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W10101338). A fundamental challenge stems from the basic trade-off between the aims of the two policy objectives - food production versus good ecological health [(Carvalho et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.12.255). The main aim of the CAP is to promote higher liberalization and competitiveness of European agriculture at the international level; however, this objective seems to be opposed to the environmental character of the Water Framework Directive [(Quiroga et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W6113300). The European Court of Auditors found that EU water policy objectives had only partially been successfully integrated into the CAP, highlighting weaknesses in the national implementation of the two instruments used for water mainstreaming: cross-compliance and rural development programme funds [(Carvalho et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.12.255). Each Member State has a choice in the balance of agricultural payments between direct income support to farmers and payments for agri-environment schemes, with generally a much higher fraction of the budget assigned to the former [(Carvalho et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.12.255). A significant setback occurred when binding references from the CAP to the Water Framework Directive were removed during the EU parliamentary process, effectively decoupling the CAP from the WFD and counteracting both the CAP's environmental goals and the ability of the WFD to achieve its aims [(Belinskij et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su11195364). This structural disconnect means that the CAP and WFD need to continue to be better aligned in terms of objectives and delivery mechanisms [(Veeren et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.17265/2162-5263/2017.07.003). Additionally, implementation of different irrigation plans has resulted in unintended consequences, achieving short-term water savings but potentially leading to increased water demand in the medium term due to greater interest in high-value crops and decoupled CAP payments that encourage agricultural production adaptation to market conditions [(Martinez et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W10050664).

## Proposed Improvements and Future Directions

**Summary:** Experts recommend creating interdisciplinary task forces at the EU level, better exploiting policy revision cycles to integrate water and agricultural objectives, and strengthening coordination between regional agricultural and environmental departments to improve future policy alignment. (3 sources)

Several key improvements have been proposed to enhance coordination between CAP subsidies and water management objectives in Spain and across the EU. At the European level, experts suggest creating an interdirectorate task force to secure full policy integration between the CAP, the Water Framework Directive, and climate policies, which could identify opportunities for allocating a much larger part of subsidies to payment for environmental services under rural development schemes [(Henriksen et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-04176-160422). This approach would ideally link CAP funding closely with the Water Framework Directive so that a major part of CAP funding goes to farmers who implement measures specified by river basin management plans [(Henriksen et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-04176-160422). The EU should exploit policy revision cycles to better integrate objectives and create coordination mechanisms and structures [(Campling et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142971). The strategic planning foreseen in the new CAP implementation arrangements after 2021 needs to be fully exploited to ensure coherence of objectives for water management and agriculture at national level, particularly given that the new policy implementation arrangements give more flexibility to EU Member States in deciding agricultural policy priorities and allocating resources for farmers to contribute to sustainable water management [(Campling et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142971). At the regional level, coordination between agricultural and environmental departments is crucial for success. New policies could serve as useful tools to promote environmental sustainability only if there is good coordination between agricultural and environmental departments at the regional level [(Fernandez et al., 2008)](https://doi.org/10.3989/ARBOR.2008.I729.162). Member States should work to streamline implementation structures and procedures based on sound governance concepts that ensure involvement of all concerned stakeholders in sustainable management of water resources and agriculture [(Campling et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142971).
