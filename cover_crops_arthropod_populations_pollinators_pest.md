## Background and Introduction to Cover Crops

**Summary:** Cover crops are plants grown between cash crops that provide multiple benefits including soil health improvement, pollinator support, and enhanced natural pest control. They represent a key component of farmscaping approaches that redesign agricultural systems to support beneficial organisms and ecosystem services. (3 sources)

Cover crops are plants grown between cash crops to improve soil health and attract beneficial insects [(Chellam et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.33545/26174693.2024.v8.i9sb.2077). These crops are planted in crop fields, either in rotation with annual crops or within perennial crops, with flowering species such as buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) or clovers (Trifolium spp.) being promoted as cover crops to provide flowering resources for insects when the main crop is not in bloom [(Rodriguez-Saona et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.5772/30375). By preventing soil erosion, increasing organic matter, and improving soil structure, cover crops contribute to more resilient and productive agroecosystems [(Chellam et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.33545/26174693.2024.v8.i9sb.2077). The use of flowering cover crops is increasingly seen as one component of an overall 'farmscaping' approach that aims to make farmland suitable for a range of beneficial organisms throughout the growing season [(Rodriguez-Saona et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.5772/30375). Farmscaping refers to the arrangement or configuration of plants that promote biological pest management by attracting and sustaining beneficial organisms, representing an ecologically based, whole-farm approach to enhancing the efficacy and local abundance of arthropod natural enemies through modification of the environment [(Philips et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1603/IPM13018). Ideally, cover crops provide shelter and resources for natural enemies, enhancing their populations and hence biological control of insect pests [(Rodriguez-Saona et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.5772/30375). Beyond pest management benefits, cover crops provide numerous ecosystem services including erosion control, reduced runoff, nutrient management, pollination services, soil health improvement, as well as improved pest suppression [(Philips et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1603/IPM13018). Specific cover crop species like brassicas including mustard and rapeseed can enhance soil microbial activity and attract beneficial insects [(Chellam et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.33545/26174693.2024.v8.i9sb.2077).

## Effects on Arthropod Populations and Natural Enemies

**Summary:** Cover crops significantly enhance arthropod predator abundance and diversity in agricultural systems, with increases of up to 140% in natural enemy populations. These enhanced predator communities provide improved biological pest control services, particularly benefiting key predator groups like spiders, beetles, parasitoid wasps, and beneficial mites. (12 sources)

Cover crops have consistently demonstrated positive effects on arthropod natural enemy populations across diverse agricultural systems. Flowering cover crops can attract beneficial insects including predator wasps, hover flies, minute pirate bugs, and lady beetles, with buckwheat specifically attracting natural enemies that control orchard pests [(Small, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14888386.2017.1332529). Studies have documented that cover crops increase natural enemy presence in 72% of cases, with particularly strong effects on Hymenoptera populations (86% increase), minute pirate bugs (80% increase), spiders (40% increase), and mites and predatory thrips (100% increase) [(Abad et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.20870/OENO-ONE.2021.55.1.3599). The mechanisms behind these positive effects relate to cover crops providing essential resources for natural enemies. Cover crops offer favorable microclimates, shelter, and food sources including pollen, floral and extrafloral nectars that predatory insects require [(Saenz-Romo et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/insects10120421) [(Herrera et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239847). Agricultural intensification has reduced arthropod diversity in agroecosystems, but cover crops serve as one of the most frequently used agroecological practices to enhance habitats for natural enemies in degraded farmlands [(Pedro et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10040580). Research has shown that diverse cover crops can enhance natural enemy abundance by 140% compared to control treatments, with particularly strong effects in landscapes with lower semi-natural habitat availability [(Beaumelle et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1002/2688-8319.12086) [(Dainese et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1101/554170). Ground-dwelling predators show especially strong responses, with cover crop treatments significantly increasing the diversity of arthropod predators including key pest control agents like ants and spiders [(Pedro et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10040580) [(Dong et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2021.697864). The composition and management of cover crops influences their effectiveness for supporting natural enemies. Mixed legume and cereal cover crops have shown particular promise, with vetch/pea/barley mixtures resulting in significantly higher parasitic wasp activity compared to weed-dominated controls [(Volakakis et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12102576). Intercropping systems with cover crops enhance soil organic matter and create stable insect community structures with increased numbers of natural enemies like predatory beetles and mites [(Pokharel et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/plants12122361) [(Li et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36591-x). These enhanced predator communities demonstrate improved biological control services over time, as cover crop establishment creates durable refuge areas that support natural enemy conservation in agricultural ecosystems [(Peris-Felipo et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/insects12080740).

## Pollinator Support and Pollination Services

**Summary:** Cover crops provide essential floral resources that significantly enhance pollinator populations and diversity in agricultural systems. Flowering cover crops attract diverse pollinators including native bees, honey bees, and other beneficial insects, supporting critical pollination services for crop production while helping address pollinator habitat loss. (11 sources)

Cover crops serve as vital habitat and resource providers for pollinators, addressing the critical need for floral resources in simplified agricultural landscapes. Different cover crop species with varying blooming periods provide habitat and resources for potential wild pollinators, particularly native bees, making flowering cover crops valuable for pollinator conservation purposes [(Kocira et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10090394). The diversity and density of pollinator insects consistently increase with cover crop implementation, with studies showing positive effects across all cases examined [(Abad et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.20870/OENO-ONE.2021.55.1.3599). Specific cover crop species demonstrate particular value for different pollinator groups. Buckwheat planted as soil cover between orchard trees serves to attract insects needed for pollination, benefiting local pollinator biodiversity which is particularly important given that bees and bee habitat are decreasing [(Small, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14888386.2017.1332529). Phacelia monoculture proves most attractive for bees in the Apidae and Halictidae families, both of which provide important pollination services, while increased floral diversity associates with greater abundance of beneficial flies in the Syrphidae family [(Candelaria-Morales et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1017/s1742170521000545). Research demonstrates that flowering cover crops significantly outperform unmanaged systems in supporting pollinators. Studies show that diversity and abundance of wild bees increase with cover crops composed of flowering species like Phacelia tanacetifolia, Ammi majus, and Daucus carota compared to tilled soils and natural vegetation [(Abad et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.20870/OENO-ONE.2021.55.1.3599). Floral plantings significantly increase pollinator abundance within margins compared to unmanaged areas, with higher floral cover within margins leading to significantly greater pollinator abundance [(Middleton et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/insects12020091). The timing and diversity of cover crop plantings enhance their pollinator support value. Winter cover crops that include early-flowering vetches provide beneficial forage for pollinators early in the season before many other crops have bloomed, supporting both domestic European honeybees and wild bees [(Zhang et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.4236/AS.2017.85031). Mass-flowering crops attract more arthropods than legumes or cereals, with intercropping systems potentially increasing flower visits by insects up to 1.5 million per hectare, likely supporting both pollination and pest-control ecosystem services [(Brandmeier et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1002/2688-8319.12267). Various flowering crops including buckwheat, caraway, phacelia, and others provide nutritional resources for both natural enemies and pollinators, with different flower types attracting specific pollinator groups - honey bees and bumble bees favor crops with concealed nectaries like mustard and phacelia, while wild bees frequent crops like flax [(Herz, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1399/JFK.2017.03.01). The positive effects of cover crop and hedgerow species richness on pollination rates have been demonstrated in fruit orchards, where most pollinator species depend on different floral resources and there is a close relationship between flowering plants and flower visitation rates by pollinating insects [(Giacalone et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11121201) [(Samnegard et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13292). This integrated approach of providing floral resources through cover crops is increasingly recognized as essential for integrated pest and pollinator management in fruit production systems [(Fountain, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/insects13030304).

## Pest Control and Biological Control Services

**Summary:** Cover crops provide significant biological pest control services by enhancing natural enemy populations that can increase pest suppression by 8-42% in diverse agricultural systems. These enhanced predator communities, including ants, spiders, and parasitoid wasps, create effective biological control of major crop pests while reducing reliance on chemical pesticides. (17 sources)

Cover crops deliver substantial biological pest control services through multiple mechanisms that enhance natural enemy effectiveness and abundance. Research demonstrates that diverse cover crops can enhance natural enemy abundance by 140% compared to control treatments, with positive cascading effects for biological pest control that are particularly strong in landscapes with limited semi-natural habitat [(Beaumelle et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1002/2688-8319.12086). The biodiversity of natural enemies directly supports pest control services, with up to 50% of landscape simplification effects on ecosystem services attributed to richness losses of service-providing organisms [(Werf et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1177/00307270221077442) [(Dainese et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1101/554170). Ground cover vegetation provides essential habitat and resources that promote biocontrol services by increasing populations of beneficial arthropods and minimizing the need for insecticides [(Franin et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.30564/re.v2i2.1776) [(Herz et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/insects10080247). Cover crops offer a constant and abundant supply of food sources for natural enemies during flowering periods, allowing predators and parasitoids to build up in agricultural systems and maintain pest populations at acceptable levels [(Kocira et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10090394). Intercropping systems with cover crops enhance soil organic matter and create stable insect community structures with increased numbers of natural enemies like predatory beetles and mites, delivering critical pest regulation services through conservation biological control [(Pokharel et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/plants12122361) [(Li et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36591-x). Several studies have documented significant improvements in pest control effectiveness with cover crop implementation. Predator densities increase with crop diversity at landscape scales, resulting in pest control that is 8 to 33% greater in high-diversity landscapes compared to low-diversity systems [(Werf et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1177/00307270221077442). Cover crops have shown significant impacts on the diversity of ground-dwelling arthropods, including key predators for pest control such as ants and spiders, with enhanced predator abundance leading to stronger aphid suppression in orchard systems [(Dong et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2021.697864) [(Pedro et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10040580). In Mediterranean olive grove systems specifically, cover crops provide critical habitat management benefits for biological control. Soil cover crops positively affect arthropod diversity and help maintain natural enemy populations that are essential for controlling major olive pests like the olive fruit fly (Bactrocera oleae) [(Lantero et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/app132112078) [(Carpio et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1111/afe.12303). Ground cover vegetation provides food resources, refuge, and reproduction sites for natural enemies including predators and parasitoids that play key roles in pest control, with species like Chrysopidae serving as efficient biological control agents against olive moth and other primary olive pests [(Herrera et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/plants11233255) [(Herrera et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/insects10050134). The incorporation of natural or planted groundcover vegetation enhances the abundance of various natural enemy groups, with studies showing increased mortality of olive fruit fly pupae and higher carbon accumulation in soils supporting diverse arthropod communities [(Michail et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture15080898) [(Stavrianakis et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21683565.2024.2364739). The integration of cover crops into pest management systems represents an increasingly important component of integrated pest and pollinator management approaches, where provision of floral resources through cover crops encourages both natural enemies and pollinators with mostly beneficial impacts on pest regulation services in fruit production systems [(Fountain, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/insects13030304).

## Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services

**Summary:** Cover crops significantly enhance agricultural biodiversity across multiple levels, from soil microbial communities to arthropod diversity, while providing critical ecosystem services including pest suppression, pollination support, and soil health improvement. These biodiversity benefits are particularly pronounced in Mediterranean olive groves, where cover crops create more complex trophic webs and support diverse beneficial insect communities. (8 sources)

Cover crops serve as a cornerstone practice for enhancing agricultural biodiversity and ecosystem service provision across multiple biological levels. Biodiversity services include above-ground metrics such as insect biodiversity and plant species biodiversity, as well as below-ground metrics including soil food web biodiversity and microbial biodiversity, with biodiversity playing a central role in maintaining ecosystem processes [(Creze et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11050862). Sustainable agronomic practices including cover crops create suitable habitats that provide food and shelter to pollinators and natural enemies of insect pests in disturbed agro-ecosystems [(Karamaouna et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/insects12010031). The structural complexity provided by cover crops creates cascading effects on arthropod communities and ecosystem functioning. Previous studies have shown the positive effect of vegetation diversity and landscape complexity on the abundance and diversity of arthropods in olive orchards, where cover crops strongly enhance their communities and include pest control insect species [(Carpio et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5424/sjar/2020182-15991). Results suggest that arthropod richness and abundance depend on the structural complexity provided by cover crops, which may be due to higher food abundance and shelter when cover crops are present [(Carpio et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5424/sjar/2020182-15991). In Mediterranean olive production systems, cover crops demonstrate particularly strong biodiversity benefits through their effects on trophic web complexity. Olive groves with spontaneous cover had trophic webs with a higher number of plausible links between arthropod families and a more balanced distribution of specimens among trophic levels compared to those with planted cover and bare ground [(Castro et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.14411/EJE.2021.017). The complexity of plausible trophic links was greater in olive groves with spontaneous plant cover despite similar values for family richness, with more diverse qualitative functional traits in agroecosystems with spontaneous plant cover where there were more sources of food [(Castro et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.14411/EJE.2021.017). Cover crops and intercropping systems provide alternative habitats for arthropod communities while serving as good sources of food for pollinators in terms of pollen grains and nectar [(El-Shafie, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.102035). Research has documented 69 insect species including pollinators and predators belonging to five orders and 17 families in systems with living mulch cover crops [(Casas et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/plants11040545). Conservative agriculture practices including minimized soil disturbance and permanent soil covering through cover crops have been shown to impact biodiversity and ecosystem service provision, reducing negative effects of conventional tillage and enhancing beneficial insects [(Casas et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/plants11040545). Management practices significantly influence biodiversity outcomes, with studies showing that higher landscape complexity, organic management, use of cover crops, and no-tillage help increase biodiversity, which ultimately improves control of major olive pests [(Gonzalez-Zamora et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/insects14100783) [(Carpio et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1111/afe.12303). Soil cover crops positively affect arthropod diversity along with plant community diversity and landscape complexity, strongly improving arthropod diversity in olive orchards while helping maintain biodiversity in intensive agroecosystems and improving other ecosystem services such as soil fertility and prevention of soil erosion [(Carpio et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1111/afe.12303). The introduction of agroecological service crops can positively influence overall ecosystem functioning by providing pest control and ecological services, representing redesign strategies that magnify the role of agro-biodiversity in ecosystem service provision [(Casas et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/plants11040545).

## Mediterranean Olive Grove Applications

**Summary:** Mediterranean olive groves demonstrate exceptional benefits from cover crop implementation, with enhanced arthropod diversity, improved biological control of major pests like olive fruit fly and olive moth, and strengthened ecosystem services. Management practices favoring spontaneous cover crops and reduced tillage create more complex trophic webs and support diverse natural enemy communities essential for sustainable olive production. (10 sources)

Mediterranean olive groves represent an ideal system for demonstrating the multiple benefits of cover crop integration in perennial crop production. Ground cover is commonly present in both integrated and organic olive production, particularly in orchards on sloping land, where cover crops enhance soil quality, reduce erosion risk, increase soil organic matter, enhance nutrient cycling, and improve water infiltration [(Franin et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.30564/re.v2i2.1776) [(Herrera et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/plants11233255). Ground cover promotes biocontrol services, increases populations of beneficial arthropods, and minimizes the need for insecticides, with ground-dwelling insects, spiders, and other arthropods playing important roles as predators and saprophytic organisms that enhance biological pest control and promote biodiversity [(Franin et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.30564/re.v2i2.1776). Previous studies have demonstrated the positive effect of vegetation diversity and landscape complexity on arthropod abundance and diversity in olive orchards, where cover crops strongly enhance arthropod communities and include pest control insect species [(Carpio et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5424/sjar/2020182-15991). The structural complexity provided by cover crops creates favorable conditions with higher food abundance and shelter availability for beneficial arthropods [(Carpio et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5424/sjar/2020182-15991). The type and management of cover crops significantly influences their effectiveness in olive production systems. When different ground cover crops were compared, vetch/pea/barley seed mixtures resulted in significantly higher parasitic wasp activity than control plots dominated by weeds, with mixed legume/cereal ground cover crops serving as reservoirs for natural enemies of agricultural pests [(Volakakis et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12102576). Olive groves with spontaneous cover demonstrate particularly strong benefits, having trophic webs with higher numbers of plausible links between arthropod families and more balanced distribution of specimens among trophic levels compared to planted cover and bare ground systems [(Castro et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.14411/EJE.2021.017). Cover crops in olive groves provide critical habitat for natural enemies that control major Mediterranean olive pests. Cover vegetation provides food resources, refuge, and reproduction sites for predators and parasitoids that play key roles in pest control, with Chrysopidae serving as efficient biological control agents against olive moth (Prays oleae), one of the principal olive pests [(Herrera et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/plants11233255). Research demonstrates that higher landscape complexity, organic management, use of cover crops, and no-tillage practices help increase biodiversity, which ultimately improves control of major olive pests including Prays oleae and Bactrocera oleae (olive fruit fly) [(Gonzalez-Zamora et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/insects14100783) [(Alvarez et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.03.429537). The incorporation of natural or planted groundcover vegetation in olive groves enhances the abundance of various natural enemy groups, with studies showing increased mortality of olive fruit fly pupae and higher carbon accumulation in soils supporting diverse arthropod communities [(Michail et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture15080898). Soil cover crops positively affect arthropod diversity along with plant community diversity, strongly improving arthropod diversity in olive orchards while helping maintain biodiversity in intensive agroecosystems and improving ecosystem services such as soil fertility and erosion prevention [(Carpio et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1111/afe.12303) [(Lantero et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/app132112078). Among beneficial arthropods, ants are considered particularly important for olive fruit fly suppression, especially in the pupal stage, with generalist predators often being more efficient in biological pest control than specialist natural enemies [(Michail et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture15080898).
