**Research Query:** R.3 What is the current state of water governance in the Andalusian Mediterranean River Basin, and how does it affect agricultural practices?

---

## Introduction

**Summary:** The Andalusian Mediterranean River Basin faces complex water governance challenges due to water scarcity, competing demands, and fragmented management systems. These issues directly impact agricultural practices through water allocation decisions, pricing policies, and infrastructure development. (LLM Memory)

The Andalusian Mediterranean River Basin represents one of Spain's most water-stressed regions, where governance systems must balance limited water resources among urban, agricultural, and environmental needs . The basin encompasses several river systems along Andalusia's Mediterranean coast, including areas with intensive agricultural production that depends heavily on both surface water and groundwater resources . Water governance in this region operates through a multi-level framework involving national water policy, regional Andalusian authorities, and local water user associations, creating a complex institutional landscape that shapes how water is allocated and managed . The current governance structure faces significant pressures from climate change, increasing water demand from urban development and tourism, and the need to maintain agricultural competitiveness in global markets . These governance decisions directly influence agricultural practices by determining water availability, establishing pricing mechanisms, and setting rules for water use that farmers must navigate to maintain their operations .

## Water Governance Structure and Framework

**Summary:** Water governance in the Andalusian Mediterranean River Basin operates through a regional authority system established by Spain's 1985 Water Act, which transferred groundwater to public domain and created River Basin Authorities with management responsibilities. The region faces structural governance shortcomings including inadequate planning, weak enforcement of water quotas, and lack of flexible regulatory mechanisms. (3 sources)

The governance framework for water management in the Andalusian Mediterranean River Basin was fundamentally shaped by Spain's 1985 Water Act, which established River Basin Authorities (Confederaciones hidrográficas) as the primary administrative entities responsible for water management and planning [(Leeuwen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2019.01.018) [(Velez-Nicolas et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12125215). This legislation represented a turning point that proclaimed the inclusion of groundwater in the public domain and eliminated private rights to appropriate groundwater resources through wells and galleries [(Velez-Nicolas et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12125215). The Andalusian Mediterranean River Basin District (Demarcación Hidrográfica de las Cuencas Mediterráneas Andaluzas, DHCMA) operates under regional rather than national management because its boundaries fall entirely within the Autonomous Community of Andalusia, placing it under the authority of the regional government (Junta de Andalucía) (Junquera et al., 2024). The DHCMA is organized into 6 Systems and 16 Subsystems, reflecting the complex geographic and hydrological characteristics of the region (Junquera et al., 2024). Under this framework, water boards of river basins design their own hydrological management plans, though the Spanish Ministry of Public Works retains approval authority, leading to unequal division of water resources and disparities in inter-basin water transfers [(Leeuwen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2019.01.018). However, the current governance structure suffers from several structural shortcomings that have created chronic imbalances between water demand and available resources, including large uncertainties in water resource availability that hinder effective planning, lack of enforcement of individual water quotas, and absence of regulatory mechanisms to flexibly impose resource use restrictions at both local and regional levels (Junquera et al., 2024).

## Current Water Resources and Supply Systems

**Summary:** The Andalusian Mediterranean River Basin faces severe water deficits, with annual demand of 510 Mm³/year far exceeding available resources of 344 Mm³/year. The region relies on diverse water sources including surface water, groundwater, inter-basin transfers, reclaimed water, and desalinated seawater, with infrastructure including 65 dams and transfer facilities. (5 sources)

The Andalusian Mediterranean River Basin operates with a complex water supply system that struggles to meet regional demand through multiple interconnected sources. Available water resources in the eastern part of the basin, which includes the intensive agricultural area of Almería, amount to 344 Mm³/year, composed of surface and groundwater resources (257 Mm³/year), water transferred from external systems (41 Mm³/year), reclaimed water (11 Mm³/year), and desalinated seawater (35 Mm³/year) [(Martinez-Alvarez et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W11061233) [(Pellicer-Martinez et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.5194/HESS-22-6473-2018). However, these diverse water sources cannot satisfy the total water demand of 510 Mm³/year, which includes irrigated agriculture (429 Mm³/year), urban supply (74 Mm³/year), and industrial uses (7 Mm³/year), creating a structural water deficit of 166 Mm³/year [(Martinez-Alvarez et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W11061233) [(Pellicer-Martinez et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.5194/HESS-22-6473-2018). Water supply infrastructure in the region is highly regulated through 65 dams and specialized transfer facilities, with the Negratín-Almanzora transfer facility serving as a key component for importing water from the Guadalquivir River Basin [(Garcia, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W10101338). Inter-basin transfers through this facility are administratively limited to an annual maximum of 50 Hm³ for irrigating approximately 24,000 hectares, with transfers permitted only when water reserves in the donor basin exceed 30% of storage capacity [(Garcia, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W10101338). The chronic water deficit has resulted in severe overexploitation of groundwater resources, while reclaimed water reuse remains underdeveloped compared to coastal regions, representing only 2% of national volumes in water-stressed inland basins [(Martinez-Alvarez et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W11061233) [(Blanco-Gutierrez et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.7.e76793). This water scarcity occurs despite the region's transformation into one of the world's largest concentrated greenhouse areas, with over 30,000 hectares under plastic covering intensive agricultural production [(Cauwenbergh et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-09987-230202).

## Water Demand and Usage Patterns

**Summary:** Agriculture dominates water consumption in the Andalusian Mediterranean River Basin, accounting for over 80% of total water use with irrigated agriculture requiring 429 Mm³/year. Despite modernization efforts that have led to 84% of irrigated land using efficient sprinkler and drip systems, high-value crop production continues to drive water demand growth. (3 sources)

Agricultural water consumption represents the dominant use pattern in the Andalusian Mediterranean River Basin, accounting for more than 80% of total regional water consumption [(Gonzalez-Rosell et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12113172) [(Gonzalez-Rosell et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-023-01324-1). Specifically, irrigated agriculture consumes 429 Mm³/year out of the total water demand of 510 Mm³/year in the eastern part of the basin, which includes the intensive agricultural area of Almería [(Martinez-Alvarez et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W11061233). Urban supply accounts for 74 Mm³/year while industrial uses require only 7 Mm³/year, highlighting agriculture's overwhelming share of water demand [(Martinez-Alvarez et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W11061233). The region has undergone significant modernization in irrigation practices, with more than 84% of the total irrigated land now using sprinkler and drip irrigation systems by 2017 [(Gonzalez-Rosell et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12113172). These modernization efforts have improved efficiency and flexibility in water use as well as the profitability of the Andalusian agricultural sector [(Gonzalez-Rosell et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12113172). However, the water savings achieved through these technological improvements have been offset by expansion of irrigated areas to grow high-value crops such as fruits and vegetables, which require substantial irrigation [(Gonzalez-Rosell et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12113172). The agricultural sector faces increasing competition for water resources from industrial and urban users, while environmental groups pressure for maintaining environmental flows to protect water quality [(Gonzalez-Rosell et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12113172). Water pricing varies spatially within the basin, with upstream water service tariffs priced around €0.034/m³ and downstream tariffs around €0.064/m³ as of 2012 [(Gonzalez-Rosell et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12113172). Despite the efficiency gains from modern irrigation systems, the high degree of technological adoption has created considerable dependence on the energy sector and increased greenhouse gas emissions, thereby contributing to climate change pressures [(Gonzalez-Rosell et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-023-01324-1).

## Inter-Basin Water Transfers and Trading

**Summary:** The Andalusian Mediterranean River Basin relies heavily on inter-basin water transfers from the Guadalquivir River Basin through the Negratín-Almanzora facility, with administrative transfers limited to 50 Hm³/year at €0.13/m³. Water user associations have developed innovative trading mechanisms, including purchasing rice farms in donor basins to secure permanent water rights at approximately €0.18/m³. (3 sources)

Inter-basin water transfers represent a critical component of water supply for the Andalusian Mediterranean River Basin, operating primarily through the Negratín-Almanzora transfer facility that imports water from the Guadalquivir River Basin (GRB) for irrigation purposes based on water trading mechanisms [(Garcia, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W10101338). These administrative transfers are limited to an annual maximum of 50 Hm³ for irrigating approximately 24,000 hectares, with a fixed transfer cost of €0.13/m³ that covers all financial costs of the transfer facility [(Garcia, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W10101338). Transfer permissions depend on hydrological conditions in the donor basin, with no transfers allowed when water reserves fall below 30% of the GRB storage capacity, though users have been able to negotiate water sales under special authorization during drought periods [(Garcia, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W10101338). Water user associations have developed innovative trading strategies to secure more reliable water access beyond administrative transfer limits. In December 2006, Aguas de Almanzora, a consortium of 18 irrigator associations in the Mediterranean Andalusian River Basin, purchased rice farms in the downstream Guadalquivir River Basin to acquire permanent water-use rights and transfer water for horticultural crops and citrus trees [(Garcia, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W10101338). This strategic acquisition allowed transfers of 11.97 hm³, 3.9 hm³, and 4 hm³ in 2006, 2007, and 2008 respectively, with an average purchase price of €24,000/ha for rice farms corresponding to a water price equivalent of €0.18/m³ [(Palomo-Hierro et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W7020652) [(Berbel et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.7201/EARN.2007.14.07). Additional water purchases by Aguas de Almanzora from various irrigation communities in 2007 and 2008 totaled over 29 hm³/year, all priced at approximately €0.18/m³, demonstrating the emergence of a regional water market that operates above the administrative transfer price [(Palomo-Hierro et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W7020652).

## Challenges in Water Governance

**Summary:** Water governance in the Andalusian Mediterranean River Basin faces structural shortcomings including lack of enforcement of water quotas, absence of flexible regulatory mechanisms, and chronic imbalances between demand and resources. These challenges are compounded by failed policy responses, high energy costs from irrigation modernization, and inefficient drought management systems that disproportionately impact agriculture. (6 sources)

The Andalusian Mediterranean River Basin suffers from several structural governance shortcomings that have created chronic and long-term imbalances between water demand and available resources. These include large uncertainties in water resource availability and use that hamper effective planning, lack of enforcement of individual water quotas, and the absence of regulatory mechanisms to flexibly impose resource use restrictions at both local and regional levels based on the overall resources of the system (Junquera et al., 2024). The near-depletion of reservoir and groundwater resources occurs within short timespans due to exogenous meteorological triggers coupled with endogenous social-institutional shortcomings in land and water management that have resulted in growing structural imbalances and loss of resilience over decades (Junquera et al., 2024). Policy responses to water scarcity have often failed or created unintended consequences that compound governance challenges. In the late 1990s to early 2000s, with a lack of groundwater management in the southern Mediterranean coastal belt, authorities initially looked to divert water from the Ebro river in the north to compensate for rapidly depleting aquifers, but when the National Hydrological Plan of 2001 was derailed, Plan B centered on constructing desalination plants along the coast [(Holley et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23576-9_9). However, Spanish farmers balked at paying for expensive desalinated water in bulk to substitute groundwater abstractions, despite the fact that desalinated water prices are subsidized and do not reflect the true costs borne by taxpayers [(Holley et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23576-9_9). The modernization of irrigation systems has created an unexpected governance challenge through dramatically increased energy dependence in the agricultural sector. The replacement of traditional irrigation systems with pressurized systems has led to higher energy requirements, and along with energy market liberalization in 2008, has dramatically increased irrigation costs [(Martinez et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w11091854) [(Corominas, 2010)](https://doi.org/10.4995/IA.2010.2977). Water abstraction remains high despite conservation efforts, with the water exploitation index exceeding the 40% threshold due mainly to irrigation water withdrawn in river basins such as the Guadalquivir [(Martinez et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w11091854). Drought management systems present additional governance challenges through inefficient allocation mechanisms and disproportionate impacts on agriculture. During periods of scarcity, water supply restrictions almost exclusively affect allocations for agricultural purposes due to the legally established priority of urban over agricultural uses [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12061835). The proportional rule used for water rationing during scarcity fails to achieve Pareto-efficient allocation arrangements, while farmers face continued decline in farm incomes due to increasing input costs and lower commodity prices [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12061835) [(Exposito et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU9071144).

## Effects on Agricultural Practices

**Summary:** Water governance decisions in the Andalusian Mediterranean River Basin have fundamentally transformed agricultural practices, driving a shift from traditional rainfed farming to intensive irrigation systems and high-tech greenhouse cultivation. These changes have created both opportunities for high-value crop production and new vulnerabilities including soil erosion, energy dependence, and increased climate pressures. (5 sources)

Water governance policies have triggered fundamental transformations in agricultural land use and farming practices throughout the Andalusian Mediterranean River Basin. The 1985 Water Act's approach to water allocation resulted in farmers progressively abandoning traditional rainfed farming as irrigated fields expanded, with water boards and the Spanish Ministry of Public Works determining which agricultural areas had access to water and irrigation [(Leeuwen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2019.01.018). This policy-driven shift enabled farmers to take advantage of high insolation and newly constructed irrigation schemes to create attractive environments for growing commercial fruit species, fundamentally changing traditional land management from terraced landscapes to leveled-irrigated landscapes [(Leeuwen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2019.01.018). The most dramatic manifestation of these governance-driven changes is the development of intensive greenhouse agriculture, particularly in the eastern part of the basin around Almería. What was traditionally a poor and remote Spanish province was transformed by an economic boom starting in the late 1960s, based on intensive agriculture under plastic greenhouses, creating over 30,000 hectares under plastic that now represents the largest concentrated surface area of greenhouses in the world [(Cauwenbergh et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-09987-230202). These high-tech greenhouses continuously incorporate technological innovations including soil-less cultivation, hydroponics, and biological pest and disease control, with the greenhouse area progressively increasing over the last 50 years to cover 31,034 hectares, of which 26,590 hectares are under biological production [(Martinez-Alvarez et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W11061233). However, these governance-induced agricultural transformations have created significant environmental and operational challenges for farmers. The land use changes from traditional to irrigated agriculture have triggered soil erosion and resulted in extreme pressure on groundwater resources [(Leeuwen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2019.01.018). Despite water savings from modern irrigation systems covering more than 84% of total irrigated land, these efficiency gains are offset as irrigated areas expand to grow high-value crops such as fruits and vegetables that require substantial irrigation [(Gonzalez-Rosell et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12113172). The modernization driven by water governance policies has created an unexpected dependency that affects daily agricultural operations. The high degree of modern irrigation systems requires higher energy consumption, creating considerable dependence on the energy sector and leading to higher greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change pressures [(Gonzalez-Rosell et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-023-01324-1). Agricultural practices must now navigate increasing external pressures including competition with industrial and urban water users, environmental groups demanding maintained water quality, and European Water Framework Directive measures such as cost recovery through water pricing that directly impact food production costs [(Gonzalez-Rosell et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12113172).

## Policy Responses and Modernization Efforts

**Summary:** Policy responses in the Andalusian Mediterranean River Basin have focused on irrigation modernization, infrastructure development, and regulatory measures to address water scarcity. However, these efforts have achieved limited success due to insufficient funding, continued high water abstraction rates, and unintended consequences such as increased energy dependence and costs. (7 sources)

Public administrations have implemented comprehensive irrigation modernization plans targeting water conservation through infrastructure improvements and replacement of traditional surface irrigation systems with drip and sprinkler irrigation methods [(Martinez et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w11091854). These modernization efforts have achieved significant technological adoption, with more than 84% of total irrigated land now using modernized irrigation systems, improving efficiency and flexibility in water use as well as profitability of the Andalusian agricultural sector [(Gonzalez-Rosell et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12113172) [(Gonzalez-Rosell et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-023-01324-1). Water pricing measures have been identified by stakeholders as one of the main solutions for achieving water security in the region, with cost-recovery measures implemented through the European Water Framework Directive directly impacting food production costs [(Gonzalez-Rosell et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12113172) [(Gonzalez-Rosell et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-023-01324-1). Despite these modernization efforts, policy responses have shown limited effectiveness in reducing overall water consumption. Water abstraction remains high, with the water exploitation index exceeding the 40% threshold due mainly to irrigation water withdrawn in river basins such as the Guadalquivir [(Martinez et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w11091854). In the Guadalquivir Basin, hydrological plans for 2009-2015 and 2016-2021 contemplated measures including six new dams to increase water resources, but due to financial shortcomings, less than 11% of the estimated investment was actually executed [(Lafuente et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/resources9030022). Policy responses have created unintended consequences that compound water management challenges. The replacement of traditional irrigation systems with pressurized systems has dramatically increased energy dependence in the agricultural sector, and combined with energy market liberalization in 2008, has dramatically increased irrigation costs [(Martinez et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w11091854) [(Corominas, 2010)](https://doi.org/10.4995/IA.2010.2977). Public responses to water scarcity have focused on improving efficiency, supply control, and cost-recovery measures, resulting in increased water costs with 10% real increase for surface water and 15% for groundwater between 1997-2008, while farmers face continued decline in farm incomes due to increasing input costs and lower commodity prices [(Exposito et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU9071144). Institutional changes have occurred in response to European Union Water Framework Directive requirements, with water agencies undergoing changes in staffing and procedures to comply with new legal demands. New staff members with profiles outside civil engineering have entered water agencies, slowly changing the traditional "concrete and steel brotherhood" approach to water management [(Cauwenbergh et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-09987-230202). However, fragmentation of responsibilities in the water arena and weak interpretation of the coordinating role of water administration continue to undermine democratic governance sought through public participation [(Cauwenbergh et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-09987-230202).
