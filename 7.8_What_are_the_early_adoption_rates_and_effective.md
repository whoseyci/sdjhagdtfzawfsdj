**Research Query:** 7.8 What are the early adoption rates and effectiveness of CAP eco-schemes introduced in 2023, and what factors influence farmer participation?

## Background

**Summary:** The EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) introduced new eco-schemes in 2023 that incorporated some practitioner suggestions like shorter commitment periods, but many other recommendations from farmers and agricultural experts have not yet been implemented in these environmental programs.

The Common Agricultural Policy eco-schemes represent a significant shift in EU agricultural policy, officially launching in 2023 after extensive consultation and planning. While these new schemes incorporated some improvements based on practitioner feedback, such as offering shorter commitment periods to make participation more attractive to farmers, the implementation fell short of many expectations (Zindler et al., 2023). The gap between practitioner recommendations and actual policy implementation suggests that the 2023 eco-schemes may represent a first iteration rather than a fully optimized system, potentially impacting both adoption rates and program effectiveness as farmers encounter schemes that may not fully address their operational concerns and suggestions.

## Early Adoption Rates

**Summary:** Early adoption of CAP eco-schemes in 2023 shows mixed results, with some practices like intercropping gaining support but significant regional variations in farmer participation, particularly low uptake in economically weaker farming areas with poor farm structures. (2 sources)

The 2023 launch of CAP eco-schemes has shown encouraging signs for certain agricultural practices, with intercropping among the supported practices that may see increased adoption rates [(Ha et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40100-024-00306-w). However, actual participation data reveals concerning geographic and economic disparities in adoption patterns. In Poland, a significant number of farms did not benefit from eco-scheme subsidies in the first year, with participation heavily skewed toward regions with better farm structures and higher levels of agricultural development [(Zielinski et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17062781). Areas with poorer farm structures and economically weaker operations showed notably lower participation rates, particularly in regions where at least 75% of total utilized agricultural area is classified as Areas with Natural Constraints (ANC), where eco-scheme usage was deemed "not satisfactory" [(Zielinski et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17062781). This uneven adoption pattern suggests that while the eco-schemes may hold promise for certain practices and regions, the overall effectiveness is being limited by structural and economic barriers that prevent participation among farms that might benefit most from support.

## Factors Influencing Farmer Participation

**Summary:** Regional farming conditions, farm structure quality, economic strength, natural constraints, and inadequate training programs are key factors that determine whether farmers participate in CAP eco-schemes. Areas with poor farm structures and challenging natural conditions show much lower participation rates. (1 source)

Several key factors emerge as critical determinants of farmer participation in the 2023 CAP eco-schemes: • **Regional farm structure quality** - Farmers in regions with better-structured farms show higher participation rates, while areas with poorer farm structures consistently demonstrate lower uptake [(Zielinski et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17062781) • **Economic capacity of farming operations** - Economically stronger farms are more likely to participate, whereas economically weaker farms face barriers to eco-scheme adoption [(Zielinski et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17062781) • **Natural farming conditions** - Areas with unfavorable natural conditions for farming, particularly those classified as Areas with Natural Constraints (ANC), show significantly reduced participation in eco-schemes [(Zielinski et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17062781) • **Geographic location and development level** - Regions with higher levels of agricultural development demonstrate stronger farmer willingness to implement eco-schemes compared to less developed areas [(Zielinski et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17062781) • **Adequacy of training and outreach programs** - Insufficient regional and locally specific agricultural training campaigns limit farmers' ability to identify and implement eco-scheme practices that match their specific abilities, needs, and existing farming conditions [(Zielinski et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17062781)

### Table

| Study Region | Objective Of Study | Eco-Scheme Implementation | Factors Of Adoption | Challenges Identified | Impact On Soil Fertility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Poland, Areas Facing Natural or Other Specific Constraints (ANCs) | Determine the capacity of Polish agriculture to adopt eco-schemes in 2023. | Limited adoption, focuses on increasing soil fertility, rational fertilization. | Not satisfactory use in ANCs; widespread implementation needed. | Use of eco-schemes in ANCs not satisfactory. | Increasing soil fertility through rational fertilization. |
