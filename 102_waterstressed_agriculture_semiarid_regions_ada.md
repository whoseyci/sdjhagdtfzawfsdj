## Introduction: Water Stress Challenges in Semi-Arid Agriculture

**Summary:** Semi-arid regions face severe water limitations that threaten agricultural sustainability, with climate change worsening these challenges through increased drought frequency, declining snowpack, and groundwater depletion. These water-stressed environments require immediate adoption of adaptive management strategies to maintain food production while protecting vulnerable ecosystems and communities. (9 sources)

Water scarcity represents the most critical constraint facing agricultural systems in semi-arid regions worldwide. Water is the most important limiting factor for agricultural production and ecosystem protection in semi-arid conditions, making it essential to maintain a delicate balance between ecosystem protection and sustainable development of local society [(Yang et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W7115959). Among the numerous stresses affecting plant productivity globally, soil water stress (drought) is the most common growth limiting factor in arid and semi-arid regions [(Zaman et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-96190-3) [(Saranga et al., 2001)](https://doi.org/10.1101/GR.157201). Climate change has significantly worsened these water stress challenges. Arid and semi-arid regions, which cover approximately 40% of the global land surface, face severe challenges in maintaining soil moisture due to high evaporation rates and erratic precipitation [(Rehman et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.71454/pa.004.02.0129). The impacts of climate change are particularly pronounced in semi-arid regions, where fluctuating rainfall patterns, rising temperatures, and increasing frequency of drought events challenge agricultural production [(Mechri et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1088/2515-7620/adb3f8). Climate change has compounded water imbalances through increased evaporative demand and diminished snowpack, with spring snowpack declining 15-30% across the western US [(Abatzoglou et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/adb1f5) [(Mote et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41612-018-0012-1). The consequences extend beyond immediate water availability. Notable research shows that rapid groundwater-level declines are widespread in the twenty-first century, especially in dry regions with extensive croplands, with groundwater-level declines accelerating over the past four decades in 30% of the world's regional aquifers [(Abatzoglou et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/adb1f5) [(Jasechko et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06879-8). These changes threaten not only the long-term viability of agriculture in affected areas but also local economies and water security of vulnerable communities [(Abatzoglou et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/adb1f5) [(Rodriguez-Flores et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad0d39). Semi-arid regions are highly vulnerable to soil degradation, reduced water availability, and loss of soil fertility, all of which directly affect crop productivity [(Mechri et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1088/2515-7620/adb3f8).

## Adaptive Management Strategies for Water-Stressed Agriculture

**Summary:** Successful adaptation in water-stressed agriculture requires a multi-faceted approach combining water management techniques, technological innovations, and sustainable farming practices, with implementation success strongly influenced by local socioeconomic conditions and farmer access to resources. Effective strategies range from rainwater harvesting and deficit irrigation to crop diversification and soil conservation, but must be tailored to specific regional contexts. (9 sources)

Agricultural systems in semi-arid regions must implement comprehensive adaptive strategies to address escalating water stress challenges. Basic adaptive measures such as changes in crop pattern, crop breeding and types and innovative technologies which use less water are essential to prevent further decline in global food production, especially in arid and semi-arid areas [(Misra, 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.IJSBE.2014.04.006). Research has identified 31 adaptation strategies across five main categories: water management, sustainable resource management, technological developments, farm production practices, and farm management, with water management and farm production practices being the most commonly implemented strategies by farmers [(Harmanny et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-019-01494-8). Water conservation and management form the foundation of adaptive strategies. Countries with arid and semi-arid regions should implement programs related to groundwater development such as rainwater harvesting, watershed management, and formation of artificial recharge facilities with wastewater and rainwater on a large scale [(Misra, 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.IJSBE.2014.04.006). The adoption of ex-situ rainwater harvesting techniques and in-situ or in-field rainwater harvesting by basin or ripper tillage systems help mitigate the effects of intra-seasonal dry spells on crops [(Awala et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.32642/WIJAS.V1I0.1364) . These basin systems can conserve 18-24% more soil water on sandy loam soils and 4-12% more on clay loam soils compared to conventional practices during critical maize growth stages . Irrigation innovation represents a crucial adaptive response to increasing water limitations. Higher air temperatures and less precipitation, together with increasing limitations in available water resources, have led to the adoption of alternative irrigation strategies such as deficit irrigation [(Begizew, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.17352/2455-815x.000113). Matching crop water demand with seasonal supply of irrigation water enables crops to escape terminal water stress [(Begizew, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.17352/2455-815x.000113) [(Vadez et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1071/FP13149). Smart irrigation systems and water-efficient farming practices represent promising technological solutions that need further development and scaling up [(Yin et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17062760). Crop and farming system diversification provides essential resilience against climate variability. Agricultural sustainability can be achieved by harmonizing existing farming methods with local water resource and climatic conditions through cultivation of drought-resistant crops, crop diversification, and mix-cropping of dryland cereals with rice to reduce risk of total crop losses [(Awala et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.32642/WIJAS.V1I0.1364). Agroecological approaches such as crop diversification, organic farming, and conservation agriculture promote soil health, water conservation, and biodiversity while enhancing system capacity to withstand and recover from shocks [(Namozov et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202454103003). Identified innovative practices that can be scaled up include expanding irrigation systems, adjusting crop planting times to suit localized weather forecasts, plant breeding for heat-stress tolerance, and associated agroforestry [(Atta et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5897/JAERD14.0595). The success of adaptive strategies depends heavily on contextual factors and integrated approaches. Farmers are more likely to adapt in less rural areas with lower poverty values and better market access, and in areas with higher temperatures and less rainfall, demonstrating that both biophysical and socioeconomic factors determine implementation success [(Harmanny et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-019-01494-8). No single strategy can thrive by itself in arid environments - each must be adapted to specific physical and social environments, with combined water management strategies often improving crop production in water-scarce areas [(Tahiri et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5772/INTECHOPEN.87103). For strategies to be successful, they must be economically viable, respectful of social values, and environmentally sustainable [(Tahiri et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5772/INTECHOPEN.87103).

## Climate-Smart Agriculture and Water-Saving Practices

**Summary:** Climate-smart agriculture integrates water-efficient technologies, precision irrigation systems, and adaptive crop management to maximize productivity while minimizing water use in semi-arid regions. These practices can achieve significant water savings of 25-35% while maintaining yields through strategic approaches like deficit irrigation, smart cropping systems, and conservation agriculture. (11 sources)

Climate-smart agriculture represents a comprehensive approach to agricultural management that simultaneously addresses productivity, adaptation, and mitigation goals in water-stressed environments. Climate-smart agriculture is agricultural management developed to increase sustainable food production and adapt to and mitigate climate change, with research showing it can improve productivity, incomes, profit efficiency, and food and nutritional security, promote efficient and equable water use, and mitigate climate change and greenhouse gas emissions [(Cakmakci et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13051073). More efficient management of water, a resource threatened by climate change, is critical for reaching the adaptation and livelihood goals of climate-smart agriculture, with best practices for irrigation, water-harvesting technology, and terrace or contour farming systems contributing to improved water-use efficiency and conservation [(Scherr et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1186/2048-7010-1-12). Precision irrigation technologies and deficit irrigation strategies form the cornerstone of water-saving practices in semi-arid agriculture. Irrigation technologies such as drip and sprinkler systems and management strategies stabilize water supplies for crop production through promoting irrigation efficiency and 'crop per drop' measurements, using adaptive conservation operations [(Hersh et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3934/environsci.2019.5.379). Deficit irrigation represents one of the most promising irrigation management strategies that utilizes collected data about water stored in the soil, evaporate losses, crop water use dynamics, and precipitation throughout the growing season [(Hersh et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3934/environsci.2019.5.379). Research demonstrates that irrigation water productivity was higher for deficit than for full irrigated treatment, indicating the feasibility of crop production in semi-arid areas using adaptive agricultural strategies including deficit irrigation and controlled water stress [(Piscitelli et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w13223285). Advanced monitoring and precision agriculture technologies enable significant water conservation gains. A case study investigating the use of a Random Forest model to optimize irrigation practices demonstrated how integrating data from soil moisture sensors, weather forecasts, and crop yield predictions can effectively dictate irrigation schedules, with the model's ability to analyze complex datasets enabling the formulation of watering strategies that reduced water use by 25% while maintaining or enhancing agricultural yields [(Imade et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.14569/ijacsa.2024.0151085). Water management technologies in irrigation, designed to maximize water use efficiency in agricultural production, are crucial in arid and semi-arid regions, with various technologies such as deficit irrigation being tested to improve irrigation water use efficiency alongside the use of drought-tolerant crop varieties [(Melo et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijpb16010016). Strategic crop selection and diversified cropping systems provide substantial water-saving opportunities. This study provides strong evidence that water savings can be achieved through policies that create incentives for adopting smart cropping strategies, with practices that can offset higher water use including double or multiple cropping practice, drought tolerant crop selection, and optimizing the total farmed area [(Myint et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos12081080). Double and multiple cropping practices result in water savings because soil moisture is retained from one planting to another, with further water savings occurring when drought tolerant crop types are selected, especially in dry years [(Myint et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos12081080). If the objective is water conservation, then priority needs to be given to crops that use less water, such as corn, wheat, and barley, especially in arid and semi-arid regions that experience serious droughts [(Myint et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos12081080). Conservation agriculture and integrated management systems demonstrate significant potential for water efficiency improvements. Conservation agriculture was suggested for dry Mediterranean conditions as a powerful tool of sustainable land management to achieve higher productivity and income and adapt to climate change and water scarcity [(Darwish et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su162210050) [(Fader et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5194/HESS-20-953-2016). Simulation using the process-based ecohydrological and agro-ecosystem model showed the potential of 35% water saving by the implementation of more efficient irrigation and conveyance systems [(Darwish et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su162210050) [(Fader et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5194/HESS-20-953-2016). Science-based practices of water and nutrient management showed higher application and agronomic water use efficiency of full fertigation, exceeding 60%, associated with double and triple higher nitrogen use efficiency, compared to those results obtained by traditional water and fertilizer application methods [(Darwish et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su162210050). Implementation of climate-smart practices requires integrated approaches tailored to local conditions. Due to moisture and soil constraints caused by climate change, the cropping system, crop succession, and soil tillage techniques require major overhaul, requiring modifying soil management and fertilisation, design of new agro-climatic zoning, including neglected and underutilised crop species in rotations, optimised sowing time windows, expanded irrigation, design of multi-functional cropping systems, conservation agriculture, and the use of climate-smart agriculture practices [(Janmohammadi et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.6001/biologija.2023.69.2.1). Using climate-smart agriculture principles and promoting related approaches specified per locality, cropping pattern and markets is central to improving agricultural development and sustainable water management [(Frimpong et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1110179).

## Constraints to Adoption of Water-Saving Practices

**Summary:** Despite proven effectiveness of water-saving technologies in semi-arid agriculture, widespread adoption faces significant barriers including financial constraints, inadequate infrastructure, limited access to technology, poor institutional support, and challenges in scaling solutions from local to regional levels. These constraints persist even when water sources are available and government infrastructure investments have been made. (4 sources)

The adoption of water-saving practices in semi-arid regions faces substantial implementation challenges despite the proven effectiveness of various technologies and strategies. Research has demonstrated success with water harvesting systems for supplemental irrigation, conservation tillage systems, drought-resistant crops, and conservation agriculture, yet the key challenge remains in the identification of the most successful combination of possible strategies and technologies in a particular context and in its dissemination mechanism over a very large scale to reach the largest number of farmers [(Burney et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-014-1186-0). This scaling challenge is exemplified by findings that local crop production remains almost entirely rain-fed or hand irrigated, with only 4 farmers out of 350 surveyed using irrigation equipment, despite nearly all farmers having access to at least one water source [(Burney et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-014-1186-0). Financial constraints and limited access to technology represent primary barriers to adoption of water-saving practices. The implementation of improved irrigation systems, drought-resistant crop varieties, conservation agriculture, and agroforestry techniques often faces challenges such as financial constraints, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to technology [(Omokaro, 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soh.2025.100113). Even when advanced technologies show significant potential for water savings, the financial and logistical considerations of setting up extensive sensor networks could pose challenges to widespread adoption [(Imade et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.14569/ijacsa.2024.0151085). The adoption of practices like drought-resistant crop varieties and conservation agriculture is often limited by financial constraints and lack of access to improved seeds and technologies [(Omokaro, 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soh.2025.100113). Institutional and capacity building constraints further limit successful implementation of water-saving practices. Identified challenges include poor institutional support, lack of participation, inadequate planning of soil and water conservation technologies, absence of research and development linkages, and insufficient capacity building [(Habtu, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.32388/6x185z.2). The success of agricultural development depends on whether water harvesting and management approaches are economically, environmentally, and socially feasible and sustainable, requiring integrated physical and biological conservation practices combined with capacity building and technology adoption research [(Habtu, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.32388/6x185z.2). The persistence of underutilization occurs even when infrastructure investments have been made by governments. This underutilization of smallholder water management technologies persists despite the fact that over the past half-century, the Brazilian government has constructed hundreds of small earth dams and wells to help with annual smoothing of seasonal water resources [(Burney et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-014-1186-0). This suggests that infrastructure availability alone is insufficient without addressing the broader constraints of technology dissemination, farmer training, and economic viability of water-saving practices.

## Learning from Arid Regions: Soil Conservation Approaches

**Summary:** Successful soil conservation in arid regions relies on integrated approaches combining traditional practices like conservation tillage, crop residue management, and rainwater harvesting with innovative techniques such as Zai pits and agroforestry systems. These proven strategies enhance water retention, improve soil organic matter, and increase crop productivity while building resilience against drought and climate variability. (16 sources)

Arid and semi-arid regions worldwide have developed and refined soil conservation approaches that serve as valuable models for water-stressed agriculture globally. Water shortage is the major constraint to agricultural production in rainfed farming systems of arid and semi-arid areas, with conservation tillage systems demonstrated in the semiarid region of the Loess Plateau, increasing water use efficiency by 11%, while no-tillage and subsoiling tillage practices show promise in increasing soil water storage, improving water use efficiency and increasing crop yield [(Wang et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep12225). The sustainability and adaptation challenges faced in regions like the Texas Southern High Plains are similar to challenges in other semi-arid regions across the globe that rely heavily on agriculture, such as in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Africa, Inner Mongolia and the Loess Plateau of northern China, and the northeastern region of Brazil [(Slaughter et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.36783/18069657RBCS20200163). In-situ soil and water conservation practices form the foundation of successful adaptation strategies in arid regions. For effective drought adaptation and mitigation measures, integrated in-situ soil and water conservation practices of reducing tillage, optimum utilization of fertilizers and manures, reduction of field level greenhouse gases, afforestation practices and other soil water conservation practices of crop rotation, mulching practices, maintenance of water retention and detention structures, construction of farm ponds and percolation ponds play an important role in semi-arid pastoral and agricultural watersheds [(Muralikrishnan et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14010006). These practices are particularly crucial given that semi-arid regions access water from less numbers of rainy days (1/10th of rainy days per annum), thus in-situ soil and water conservation at watershed level can effectively support in the remaining periods of drier seasons [(Muralikrishnan et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14010006). The "more carbon per drop" approach represents an innovative framework for enhancing both carbon sequestration and water conservation in water-limited environments. This approach emphasizes increasing soil organic carbon sequestration and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by enhancing water use efficiency and soil water storage, with agricultural strategies that increase the amount and diversity of carbon inputs, improve nutrient availability for crops, and minimize soil disturbance simultaneously sequestering soil carbon and enhancing soil water storage [(Ghimire et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1080/17583004.2022.2117082). Developing management practices that result in greater water availability to the root system can improve food safety in semi-arid environments, with maintaining water in the soil being an important element for adapting annual crops to water deficit [(Lima et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.36783/18069657rbcs20230024) [(Gao et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erw243). Traditional and indigenous practices provide proven, cost-effective solutions for soil conservation in arid regions. Various in-field rainwater collection techniques, including Zai pits, have been promoted in recent years to assist farmers, particularly in dry and semi-arid locations, to harvest, store, and use rainfall for increased crop productivity, with Zai pit technology and integrated soil fertility management techniques being utilized as climate smart agricultural approaches to reduce soil moisture stress and improve crop productivity [(Kebenei et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.22161/ijeab.81.8). Traditional practices, such as the use of leguminous trees to enhance soil fertility and provide livestock feed during dry seasons, are highly effective in mitigating climate-induced challenges, with indigenous knowledge including techniques for managing biodiversity, restoring degraded lands, and ensuring the sustainability of local resources [(Pirasteh et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2025.e42617) [(Assani et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-023-00899-z). Integrated conservation systems demonstrate superior outcomes when multiple practices are combined strategically. The responses of soil health indicators are generally greater when multiple complementary soil health management practices are integrated, leading to the resilience and sustainability of agriculture in water-limited environments [(Ghimire et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems7010022). Studies demonstrate that adopting conservation systems can increase soil organic carbon storage, water infiltration, soil microbial activities, water use efficiency, and decrease nitrogen fertilizer inputs compared to conventional systems, with integrating more than one soil and water conservation practice complementing to enhance soil health and sustainability of dryland or limited-irrigation agriculture [(Nilahyane et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2023.2211484). Conservation practices such as soil cover, contour cultivation associated with rock barriers, and no-tillage farming aim at the efficient use of water without compromising crop yield [(Lima et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.36783/18069657rbcs20230024) [(Bodner et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-015-0283-4) [(Shen et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.17221/404/2011-PSE) [(Santos et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.1590/S0100-06832010000500025). Successful soil conservation approaches in arid regions emphasize the integration of leguminous species and agroforestry systems. Inclusion of rotational leguminous tree species improves soil water retention in a semi-arid conservation agriculture system, with plots containing planting basins and Gliricidia sepium and Faidherbia albida tree species retaining more water in both the upper and lower strata [(Kalinda et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.4236/OJF.2015.57059). Conservation Agriculture, Agroforestry, as well as integrated soil fertility management and field-scale rainwater harvesting, remain promising for the preservation and improvement of soil health in Africa's farmlands and improving the resilience of agrosystems to climate change and variability as well as droughts [(Diop et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su142013425).
