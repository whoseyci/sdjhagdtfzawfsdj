**Research Query:** 6.2.8 What is the effectiveness of agricultural extension and advisory services in promoting sustainable practices among olive farmers in Mediterranean regions?

---

## Introduction

**Summary:** Agricultural extension and advisory services play a crucial role in promoting sustainable olive farming practices in Mediterranean regions, but face challenges including insufficient service provision and complex regulatory constraints. Effective extension requires bidirectional communication between institutions and farmers, combined with education programs that address both environmental awareness and practical implementation of sustainable practices.

Agricultural extension and advisory services represent a critical mechanism for promoting sustainable practices among olive farmers in Mediterranean regions, though their effectiveness is influenced by multiple interconnected factors. The foundation of successful extension lies in establishing fluid information channels that facilitate both top-down knowledge transfer from institutions like FAO, EU ministries, and regional governments, as well as bottom-up communication where farmers can raise their demands and concerns to these institutions [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND9100366). However, the current landscape presents significant challenges, including insufficient agricultural extension services, complex regulatory constraints, and cultural resistance to change among farming communities [(Martins et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae10101066). The effectiveness of extension services is particularly dependent on the educational background of farmers, with education level serving as a key factor in the adoption of sustainable practices such as organic olive systems [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND9100366). This highlights the need for comprehensive approaches that integrate education for both farmers and policymakers about climate change impacts, soil degradation, and best agronomic practices, which can be facilitated through living labs, workshops, and demonstrations by industry stakeholders, farmer associations, and research institutions [(Martins et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae10101066).

## Current State of Extension Services

**Summary:** Extension services for olive farmers in Mediterranean regions show uneven provision, with significant gaps in service quality and coverage. While some regions have well-developed advisory systems through producer organizations and cooperatives, many farmers still face poor extension services and lack access to marketing guidance. (3 sources)

The current landscape of agricultural extension services for olive farmers across Mediterranean regions reveals substantial disparities in quality and accessibility. In many areas, farmers report significant deficiencies, with poor extension services affecting 48% of olive producers and absence of agricultural marketing extension impacting 59% of farmers [(Mansour et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1186/S42269-019-0112-Z) [(Mansour et al._1, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s42269-019-0112-z). These gaps persist despite efforts by agricultural extension agencies to assist olive farmers and enhance their knowledge and skills related to olive cultivation. However, the situation varies considerably across different Mediterranean contexts. In regions with well-established producer organizations (POs), extension services show more promise, particularly for olive oil production where 80% of participating POs provide promotion and assistance for environmentally friendly production practices [(Duvaleix et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122410457). These organizations deliver technical advice through multiple channels including research programs, agronomic meetings, and on-site consultations when producers deliver olives to mills. Notably, in Greece, EU support programs have become valuable tools that enhance the role of cooperatives by providing advice, equipment, and certification support to their members, with AGRO 2 certification facilitating close contact between PO agronomists and farmer members [(Duvaleix et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122410457). The disparity in service provision is particularly evident in the differential access to advisory services, where recognized POs participating in EU support programs receive comprehensive technical guidance, while farmers outside these formal structures have limited access to extension support [(Duvaleix et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122410457). This creates a two-tiered system that may exacerbate inequalities among olive farming communities in terms of sustainable practice adoption and market competitiveness.

## Evidence of Effectiveness

**Summary:** Research demonstrates that extension services can significantly improve olive farmers' adoption of sustainable practices, with over 90% of farmers reporting changes in practices after receiving agroecological assistance. However, effectiveness depends heavily on the type of service provider, frequency of contact, and quality of farmer-researcher interactions. (8 sources)

Evidence from multiple Mediterranean contexts reveals mixed but generally positive outcomes for agricultural extension services in promoting sustainable olive farming practices. Studies show that farmers who receive assistance with agroecological practices demonstrate high rates of behavioral change, with over 90% reporting modifications in their ideas and practices following extension interventions [(Souissi et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2024.1389007). This finding is supported by research indicating that the number of contacts with advisory services is positively related to the adoption of innovations, though the relationship to environmental sustainability specifically remains less clear [(Siebrecht, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12093853). The quality and source of extension services significantly influence their effectiveness. Farmers who have direct interactions with research institutions generally demonstrate better innovation capacity [(Maghni et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.30682/nm1801c). Moreover, the type of service provider affects the nature of practices adopted - farmers advised by public extension services are more likely to use preventive pest management measures, while those receiving private advisory services show greater tendency toward synthetic pesticide use [(Kaiser et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/15487733.2024.2306731). Specific evidence from olive farming contexts demonstrates that participation in extension activities directly correlates with improved knowledge of sustainable practices. Research shows that as olive growers increase their participation in extension activities, they gain significantly more knowledge of integrated pest management techniques [(Allahyari et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE7120101). This effectiveness is particularly pronounced when extension services focus on practical, low-cost sustainable techniques such as pruning, bio-pesticide application using locally available materials, and conservation agriculture methods that increase soil water retention [(Kmoch et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10103719). Digital extension tools are emerging as particularly effective mechanisms, with significant differences observed between users and non-users of digital agricultural guidance systems regarding adoption of sustainable practices including irrigation management, soil improvement, and pest control [(Alsanhani et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17062340). Extension services provided through cooperatives also show promise in fostering efficient farm management and preventing declining productivity by improving farmers' ability to obtain maximum output from available inputs [(Kashiwagi, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.30682/NM2003B).

## Challenges and Limitations

**Summary:** Agricultural extension services face significant structural and operational challenges that limit their effectiveness in promoting sustainable olive farming practices. These include inadequate service provision, lack of marketing guidance, complex regulatory constraints, and insufficient knowledge transfer about practical benefits of sustainable practices. (5 sources)

Despite efforts to support olive farmers through extension programs, multiple systemic challenges continue to undermine the effectiveness of agricultural extension services in Mediterranean regions. A primary concern is the widespread inadequacy of service provision, with poor extension services affecting 48% of olive farmers and the absence of agricultural marketing extension impacting 59% of producers [(Mansour et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1186/S42269-019-0112-Z) [(Mansour et al._1, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s42269-019-0112-z). These deficiencies persist even in regions where agricultural extension agencies actively work to assist olive farmers and enhance their knowledge and skills related to olive cultivation. The challenges extend beyond simple service availability to encompass complex regulatory constraints, insufficient agricultural extension services, limited market access for sustainably produced olives, and cultural resistance to change among farming communities [(Martins et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae10101066). These interconnected barriers create a challenging environment for extension service delivery and adoption of sustainable practices. A critical limitation lies in the knowledge transfer process itself. While stakeholders often find low-impact farming practices easy and cost-effective to implement, suggesting significant potential for adoption, research reveals reduced knowledge of the practical benefits of sustainable farming practices and inadequate technical advice to foster adoption [(Calatrava et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11050821). This knowledge gap undermines the effectiveness of extension efforts even when farmers are willing to change their practices. Perhaps most concerning is evidence suggesting that extension services may not be achieving their intended economic outcomes. Research indicates that the net profit of farmers who received extension services is almost the same as those who do not receive any extension services, with the provided services making no difference in farmer achievement regarding production and profits [(Al-Sharafat et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.3844/AJABSSP.2012.194.200). This finding suggests that current extension approaches may be inadequate or ineffective in delivering meaningful benefits to olive farmers, highlighting the need for fundamental improvements in service design and delivery.

## Key Success Factors

**Summary:** Successful agricultural extension services for sustainable olive farming depend on building social capital among farmers, establishing co-learning processes between farmers and extension agents, providing practical low-cost training, and ensuring access to trusted advisory services through recognized producer organizations. The type and source of extension provider significantly influences adoption outcomes. (4 sources)

Based on evidence from Mediterranean olive farming contexts, several critical factors determine the effectiveness of agricultural extension services in promoting sustainable practices: • **Social capital development and co-learning processes**: Barriers such as water scarcity, low profitability and uncontrolled grazing can be overcome if social capital among farmers can be increased and co-learning processes of farmers, researchers and extension agents are successfully initiated [(Kmoch et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10103719) • **Cooperative structures and economies of scale**: Cooperation allows farmers to benefit from economies of scale, improve their bargaining power, and receive agro-chemical inputs and training from extension agencies to increase the profitability of their farming activities [(Kmoch et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10103719) • **Practical, low-cost training programs**: Extension agents should provide training in low-cost phytosanitary measures, such as pruning, or the application of bio-pesticides that can be made from locally available spices, essential oils, soap or alcohol, along with conservation agriculture techniques that increase soil water holding capacity [(Kmoch et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10103719) • **Recognition and institutional support**: EU support programmes serve as valuable tools which enhance the role of cooperatives by providing advice, equipment, and certification support to their members, with advisory services provided mainly to members of producer organizations that are recognized by public authorities [(Duvaleix et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122410457) • **Trusted knowledge sources**: Farmers consider extension experts to be an informed and trusted source of knowledge for making their decisions, particularly when delivered through established producer organizations [(Duvaleix et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122410457) • **Type and source of advisory services**: The type of pest management employed by farmers is influenced by whether they receive advice from public or private extension services, with farmers advised by public extension services more likely to use preventive measures [(Kaiser et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/15487733.2024.2306731) • **Targeted educational activities**: Extension activities should target inexperienced small-scale olive farmers, as participation in extension activities directly correlates with increased knowledge of integrated pest management practices [(Allahyari et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE7120101) • **Widespread implementation**: Sustainable techniques can only achieve substantial results if they are implemented by a majority of farmers, requiring coordinated extension efforts across farming communities [(Kmoch et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10103719)

## Recommendations for Improvement

**Summary:** Improving agricultural extension services for sustainable olive farming requires establishing fluid communication channels between institutions and farmers, providing targeted financial support and training programs, expanding digital extension tools, and integrating education for both farmers and policymakers through practical demonstrations and workshops. (4 sources)

Based on the evidence and challenges identified, several key recommendations emerge for enhancing the effectiveness of agricultural extension services in promoting sustainable olive farming practices: • **Establish bidirectional communication systems**: Different institutions at different scales and with different perspectives (top-down information arising, for example, by FAO, EU, ministries, and regional governments, environmental agencies) should continuously and affordably inform farmers, and in turn, farmers should raise their demands and concerns (bottom-up information) to these institutions to create fluid and relevant information channels that result in better management of agricultural systems with a cross-cutting and adaptive objective of sustainability and rural development [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND9100366) • **Provide targeted financial support and guidance**: To achieve sustainable practice adoption objectives, it is essential to involve, guide, and financially support farmers in the knowledge and application of these good practices in their olive groves and the potential benefits they bring in terms of pest and disease control and plant health [(Lantero et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/app132112078) • **Integrate comprehensive education programs**: A key component of advancing sustainable strategies is the integration of education for both farmers and policymakers about the impacts of climate change and soil degradation, as well as the best agronomic practices to mitigate these effects, which could be facilitated through living labs, workshops, and demonstrations of products and technologies by industry stakeholders, farmer associations, and research institutions [(Martins et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae10101066) • **Expand digital extension tools**: Implement targeted educational programs under the supervision of Agricultural Extension Departments to enhance farmers' awareness and knowledge of digital agricultural guidance applications, as expanding adoption within farming communities has the potential to significantly promote sustainable agricultural practices and improve overall agricultural productivity [(Alsanhani et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17062340) • **Focus on farmer education levels**: Given that education level is a key factor in adoption of sustainable practices, carry out training workshops aimed at promoting greater awareness among farmers of environmental threats that can undermine olive-growing system sustainability, encouraging implementation of practices that help guarantee long-term viability of these systems [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND9100366) • **Address systemic barriers**: Tackle complex regulatory constraints, insufficient agricultural extension services, and limited market access for sustainably produced olives through coordinated policy interventions and institutional support [(Martins et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae10101066)
