**Research Query:** 7.4 What agri-environmental scheme designs have proven most effective at achieving environmental outcomes while maintaining farmer participation in Mediterranean countries?

---

## Background

**Summary:** Agri-environmental schemes (AES) in Mediterranean countries face unique challenges due to diverse farming systems, varying socioeconomic conditions, and complex environmental pressures including climate change and biodiversity loss. Successful scheme designs must balance environmental effectiveness with farmer economic viability and participation incentives. (LLM Memory)

Agri-environmental schemes in Mediterranean countries operate within a complex landscape of diverse agricultural systems, from intensive irrigated crops to extensive pastoral systems, each presenting different opportunities and constraints for environmental management . These regions face particular environmental pressures including water scarcity, soil erosion, habitat fragmentation, and increasing climate variability, making the design of effective schemes especially challenging . The socioeconomic context is equally complex, with farming operations ranging from small family farms to larger commercial enterprises, often with limited resources and varying levels of technical knowledge . Traditional Mediterranean farming systems have historically supported high biodiversity and cultural landscapes, but modern agricultural intensification and land abandonment threaten these values . Successful agri-environmental schemes must therefore address multiple objectives simultaneously: maintaining farmer livelihoods, preserving traditional landscapes, protecting biodiversity, and adapting to climate change . The effectiveness of these schemes depends critically on their ability to align environmental goals with farmers' economic realities and local contexts .

## Collective vs Individual Scheme Designs

**Summary:** Collective agri-environmental schemes show promise for reducing costs and improving environmental outcomes compared to individual contracts, but require higher compensation to secure farmer participation. These schemes can enhance farmer-to-farmer learning and mutual monitoring while better matching ecological scales. (2 sources)

Research comparing collective versus individual agri-environmental scheme designs reveals important trade-offs between effectiveness, costs, and farmer participation. Collective schemes offer several advantages over individual contracts, including increased farmer-to-farmer learning, enhanced incentives for farmers to monitor each other's efforts, and greater farmer buy-in to scheme performance through collaborative engagement [(Yoder, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.879). Studies demonstrate that collective subsidies can effectively increase participation through mechanisms such as group bidding for agro-biodiversity conservation contracts and bonus payments for meeting participation thresholds to reduce pesticide use [(Yoder, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.879). However, farmers require higher compensation to participate in collective schemes compared to individual arrangements. Research in Mediterranean olive systems found that farmers' willingness to accept collective rather than individual participation was €124.5/ha higher, with total compensation estimates ranging from €225-474/ha for collective schemes versus €101-349/ha for individual contracts [(Villanueva et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2015134-7376). Despite higher participation costs, collective contracts offer significant advantages in reducing transaction costs for governments by decreasing the number of applications to process and monitoring costs required [(Villanueva et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2015134-7376). When implemented to ensure spatial proximity and correct configuration of participating farms, collective schemes can achieve greater environmental effectiveness by better matching ecological scales for more efficient and sustainable natural resource management [(Villanueva et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2015134-7376).

## Role of Intermediaries and Governance Structures

**Summary:** Trusted intermediaries can reduce administrative barriers and promote local legitimacy in agri-environmental schemes. Examples include pesticide cooperatives that successfully negotiate between farmers and government agencies to achieve both high participation rates and environmental outcomes. (1 source)

The governance structure of agri-environmental schemes, particularly the role of intermediary organizations, plays a critical role in achieving both environmental effectiveness and farmer participation. Devolving some agri-environmental contract responsibilities to a trusted intermediary can reduce administrative barriers and help promote local legitimacy [(Yoder, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.879). This approach has proven particularly effective in Mediterranean and similar contexts where local trust networks and established agricultural cooperatives can serve as bridges between government agencies and individual farmers. A notable example demonstrates the power of this intermediary approach: in France, a pesticide cooperative played a critical role as a credible intermediary in negotiating with both farmers and government agencies to reduce pesticide use and secure farmer enrollment in the program [(Yoder, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.879). The success of this model highlights how the transition in underlying social acceptability becomes a fundamental component of widespread participation and effective environmental outcomes, with trusted local organizations serving as catalysts for this social change [(Yoder, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.879). This intermediary model is particularly relevant for Mediterranean countries where agricultural cooperatives and producer organizations are well-established and could potentially serve similar roles in facilitating agri-environmental scheme adoption.

## Challenges and Limitations in Mediterranean Contexts

**Summary:** Agri-environmental schemes in Mediterranean regions sometimes create unintended negative environmental consequences, particularly in sensitive areas prone to land degradation. Better policy coordination and integrated approaches are needed to prevent these adverse effects while maintaining farmer participation. (1 source)

Despite their environmental intentions, agri-environmental schemes in Mediterranean contexts face significant implementation challenges that can sometimes produce counterproductive outcomes. Research reveals that in some cases, agro-environmental schemes have become indirect drivers of land degradation, particularly in the most sensitive Mediterranean areas [(Halbac-Cotoara-Zamfir et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12208313). This paradoxical outcome highlights the complexity of designing effective schemes in regions already vulnerable to environmental stresses such as water scarcity, soil erosion, and climate variability. The root of these challenges lies in the fragmented nature of agricultural policy implementation and the need for more integrated approaches. Solutions to mitigate these negative consequences require better coordination and integration of policies to encourage land-enhancing activities by strengthening soil protection measures, and a more integrated approach to policy development that adequately accounts for multifunctional land-use options [(Halbac-Cotoara-Zamfir et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12208313). Without this coordination, individual policy tools may work at cross-purposes, creating unintended feedback effects across different crops and farm types. At the national level, effective agri-environmental schemes in Mediterranean countries require integration into broader agricultural subsidy systems that leverage sustainable and balanced spatial development while avoiding negative feedback impacts across different agricultural sectors [(Halbac-Cotoara-Zamfir et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12208313). This systems-level approach is particularly critical in Mediterranean regions where diverse farming systems and environmental conditions create complex interactions between policy interventions and environmental outcomes.

## Species-Specific and Targeted Design Approaches

**Summary:** Agri-environmental schemes achieve variable success depending on the target species, with arthropods being easier to support than plants, and birds showing mixed results based on landscape scale and complexity. Schemes designed for specific species or ecosystems tend to be more efficient than generic approaches. (2 sources)

The effectiveness of agri-environmental schemes varies significantly depending on the target taxa, with research showing both positive and negative results across different species groups. Plant diversity has proven difficult to enhance with existing agri-environmental schemes, while arthropods appear easier to support through these interventions [(Portillo et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2022.126253) [(Ponce et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.1125). Birds show particularly complex responses, with effects ranging from positive to negative depending on the scale of scheme application in the landscape and overall landscape complexity in relation to structure and composition [(Portillo et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2022.126253). The design approach itself matters significantly for scheme effectiveness. Research demonstrates that agri-environmental schemes tend to be more efficient when they are designed for specific species or ecosystems rather than using generic conservation measures [(Portillo et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2022.126253). This species-specific approach is particularly relevant for Mediterranean countries, where diverse habitats and endemic species require tailored conservation strategies. Understanding the underlying mechanisms driving species responses can further improve scheme design. Research comparing different assessment approaches found that models incorporating food availability data (measuring seed and arthropod biomass) were on average 13% better at predicting bird responses to agri-environmental schemes compared to conventional habitat-based models, despite being five times more expensive to implement [(Ponce et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.1125). This highlights the importance of considering food availability-related processes when designing targeted interventions, particularly for species-specific conservation goals in Mediterranean agricultural landscapes.

## Limitations of Available Evidence

**Summary:** Research on agri-environmental scheme effectiveness in Mediterranean countries remains limited, with many studies failing to provide region-specific analyses or comparative effectiveness data. This evidence gap makes it difficult to identify which scheme designs work best in Mediterranean contexts. (2 sources)

A significant limitation in understanding the most effective agri-environmental scheme designs for Mediterranean countries is the lack of region-specific research and analysis. Despite extensive literature on agri-environmental schemes globally, studies often fail to provide specific information about Mediterranean countries or comparative effectiveness of different scheme designs in that region [(Limbach, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2023.2174414). Even comprehensive reviews that identify numerous programs across multiple countries do not specify which countries were Mediterranean or provide specific results about effectiveness in those regions [(Witvliet et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2322251). This evidence gap represents a critical knowledge limitation for policymakers and researchers seeking to design effective schemes for Mediterranean agricultural systems. Without region-specific data on scheme performance, it becomes difficult to determine which design elements - whether collective versus individual approaches, specific governance structures, or targeted conservation measures - are most suitable for the unique environmental and socioeconomic conditions found in Mediterranean countries. Future research should prioritize generating evidence specifically from Mediterranean contexts to better inform scheme design and implementation in these regions.
