**Research Query:** M.3 How has the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework been applied to analyze agricultural and natural resource governance?

---

## Introduction and Background

**Summary:** The Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework was developed over 35 years by interdisciplinary scholars to systematically compare institutions and governance arrangements across diverse settings. The framework centers on action situations where human actors make decisions affecting each other's welfare, influenced by biophysical, social, and institutional conditions. (8 sources)

The Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework was developed by an interdisciplinary group of scholars over the past 35 years to guide systematic comparisons of institutions and governance arrangements [(Garrick et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1002/2018EF000823). The framework has been applied across a diverse range of settings from municipal governance to natural resources and the digital commons to study how different configurations of rules affect patterns of interactions among actors and the outcomes they realize [(Garrick et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1002/2018EF000823). At its core, the IAD framework is designed to enable analyses of systems in which human actors, frequently resource users, interact with each other and their social and biophysical environments [(Cox et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-12092-260117) [(Brady, 1993)](https://doi.org/10.2307/1059950). The framework centers around the concept of an action situation - a situation in which actors make decisions that jointly affect each other's welfare, with how decision makers interact depending on biophysical, social, and institutional conditions [(Cox et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-12092-260117). The IAD framework draws on theories of rational choice, collective action, common property, and social capital, focusing on the action situation composed of participants, positions, actions that respond to information and relate to potential outcomes, and the costs and benefits associated with actions and outcomes [(Moran et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-4780-7_1). Environmental conditions play a notable role in this approach since they influence actors' choices and define part of individual actors' assets and information [(Moran et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-4780-7_1). The framework emphasizes the importance of rules and institutions, where rules are prescriptions that forbid, permit, or require certain actions in particular contexts and specify authorized sanctions if prescriptions are violated [(Koontz, 2006)](https://doi.org/10.1080/15487733.2006.11907974). By creating, enforcing, and changing rules, groups of individuals may be able to overcome collective-action dilemmas [(Koontz, 2006)](https://doi.org/10.1080/15487733.2006.11907974). Over the past 10 years, the IAD framework has been expanded into frameworks for assessing the robustness and resilience of social-ecological systems and coupled infrastructure systems [(Garrick et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1002/2018EF000823) [(McGinnis et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-06387-190230) [(Anderies et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.651). As scholars worked more with the IAD framework, the integration of ecological, social, and institutional environments played an increasingly large role in understanding how different combinations of variables influenced outcomes [(2015)](https://doi.org/10.1051/NSS/2015034).

## Core Applications in Natural Resource Management

**Summary:** The IAD framework has been extensively applied to analyze common-pool resources like forests, water systems, and land resources, providing a systematic way to examine how institutional arrangements, community attributes, and physical conditions influence natural resource governance outcomes. Studies have used the framework to evaluate everything from decentralized forest management to water scarcity responses and soil conservation effectiveness. (8 sources)

The IAD framework has been extensively used for the study of common-pool resources and common-property regimes in natural resource management, proving helpful for identifying and rigorously analyzing the structure of situations, particularly the influence of rules, essential characteristics of actions and events, and the main actors and communities involved [(Bixler et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.2458/V22I1.21083). The framework has notably been used to identify drivers of collective action in natural resource management [(Bixler et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.2458/V22I1.21083). Forest governance represents one of the most notable applications of the IAD framework. Researchers have used the framework to analyze how local institutional arrangements shape outcomes in decentralized forest governance, formulating testable hypotheses about which institutional factors influence the likelihood for successful governance outcomes [(Andersson, 2006)](https://doi.org/10.1080/15487733.2006.11907975). The framework has also been applied to analyze institutional impacts on reforestation policies [(Bixler et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.2458/V22I1.21083). Water resource management constitutes another major application area where the IAD framework is commonly employed to examine common-pool resource management outcomes [(Fan et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11020483). Studies have investigated smallholder farmer communities' responses to water scarcity [(Fan et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11020483) and analyzed governance of water use from alluvial aquifers and community participation [(Onate-Valdivieso et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w13243536). The framework has been used to compare how integrated river basin management supports water security, focusing on the action arena where actors undertake activities to resolve common-pool resource problems [(Ak et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2022.1013588). The framework provides a multilevel conceptual map to investigate how people and communities self-organize across physical, institutional, and organizational boundaries to manage common resources sustainably, balancing individual use with the interests of a wider public [(Eufemia et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsrma.2023.1134393). It has been successfully applied to evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of soil and water conservation activities, understand factors and political-economic dynamics that trigger air pollution, and analyze various other natural resource governance challenges [(Onate-Valdivieso et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w13243536). The framework identifies three core groups of variables: the rules for the field of action (institutions), the collective unit of interest (community), and the attributes of the physical environment in which the community acts [(Onate-Valdivieso et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w13243536). This systematic approach allows researchers to analyze how distinct human institutions influence socio-environmental issues, with extensions like the social-ecological systems framework designed specifically for situations involving environmental and common-pool resources [(Bergamo et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2023.107276) [(McGinnis et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-06387-190230).

## Agricultural Applications

**Summary:** The IAD framework has been applied to agricultural contexts to analyze diverse governance challenges including cooperative management in quinoa production, climate change adaptation in farming systems, collective action among rural households, organic certification schemes, agri-environmental contracts, traditional farming systems, and agricultural policy implementation. (9 sources)

The IAD framework has been extensively applied to analyze agricultural governance challenges, with studies examining how institutional arrangements affect farming outcomes and collective action. Researchers have used the framework to assess cooperative activities in agricultural production, such as analyzing quinoa producer cooperatives using IAD analytical tools like the ADICO grammar and examining compliance with production rules based on interviews and surveys [(Tschopp et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.826). Climate change adaptation in agriculture represents a significant application area where the IAD framework helps unpack institutional design lessons. Within the context of climate change impacts on agriculture, which enhances risks for resource-poor rural farmers, institutional arrangements become crucial for supporting farmer adaptation [(Dinesh et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2021.615463). Action research on climate change, agriculture and food security can be viewed as an "action arena" for institutional design, with international agricultural research entities like CGIAR serving as key actors in this space [(Dinesh et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2021.615463). The framework has been adapted to analyze collective action among rural farming households, particularly in contexts with unique institutional characteristics. Studies have examined how farmland scale and various relevant systems impact farming households' participation in rural collective action, incorporating variables such as stability of farmland tenure, large-scale farmland transfer, and socialized agricultural services [(Zang et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land10111263). This work demonstrates how the generally applicable IAD framework can be adapted to specific national contexts and contribute local cases and experience to commons research [(Zang et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land10111263). Agricultural certification and standards represent another key application area. The IAD framework has been used to analyze community-based organizations managing organic labels, where members are both users of the standard and beneficiaries of the collectively managed certification [(Lemeilleur et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S174413742200008X) [(Ostrom, 2010)](https://doi.org/10.1080/19186444.2010.11658229). This application extends beyond traditional natural resource management to address collective action dilemmas in agricultural value chains and quality assurance systems. The framework has also been applied to analyze agri-environmental contracts, examining aspects such as contract characteristics, biophysical and socio-economic context conditions, targeted interactions between social and ecological systems, measurable outcomes, and evaluation criteria [(Sattler et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2023.109156). Studies have used the IAD framework to analyze traditional agricultural systems like dike-pond systems, focusing on how actors such as system managers and fish farmers interact within the physical and institutional constraints of these landscapes [(Chi et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.5334/ijc.1300) [(Cole et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.864). Finally, the IAD framework has been employed to analyze agricultural policy implementation, examining how exogenous variables such as physical conditions, community attributes, and operational rules influence policy effectiveness in promoting integration of small-scale farmers into modern agriculture [(Liu et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.69473/iasr.2024.27.1.21).

## Methodological Adaptations and Extensions

**Summary:** Scholars have adapted and extended the IAD framework beyond its original common-pool resource focus to address more complex governance challenges, developing specialized versions like politicized IAD, network of action situations approaches, and multi-stakeholder platform analysis frameworks. These adaptations have enabled analysis of conservation policies, multi-level governance systems, and power dynamics in natural resource management. (12 sources)

The conventional application of the IAD framework examines common pool resource situations at a point in time, allowing scholars to examine how a fixed configuration of biophysical and community characteristics along with rules in use structure the interactions among actors and the outcomes they achieve [(Schlager, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.767). However, researchers have developed numerous methodological adaptations to extend the framework's analytical capacity beyond its original scope. One significant adaptation is the "politicized" IAD framework, which explicitly considers important contextual variables and brings attention to the role of political economy, discourse, and power in studies of natural resource management [(Whaley, 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-06177-190110). This politicized version is well suited to the study of adaptive comanagement and provides breadth, clarity, and structure by drawing attention to the range of variables and questions to be considered when attempting a study of comanagement [(Whaley, 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-06177-190110) [(Whaley, 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-07769-200343). Researchers have adapted the framework to analyze conservation policy instruments, despite the IAD framework being primarily developed for common-pool resource management. The framework clearly identifies the functional characteristics of policy instruments, offers a systematic institutional codification and typology, and provides a rigorous mechanism for conducting institutional analysis of particular policies [(Zaga-Mendez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5334/ijc.1002). The Network of Action Situations (NAS) approach represents another significant extension, developed within the IAD framework to study socially or physically connected situations of interdependent decision-making in social-ecological systems [(Kasymov et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01198-9) [(Kellner, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01170-7). This approach investigates linkages and interdependencies between multiple action situations and addresses limitations of traditional frameworks that focus on small-scale systems and single policy areas [(Kellner, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01170-7). Scholars have developed multi-level analytical approaches drawing on the IAD framework's multi-level rule hierarchy, which suggests that institutions are arranged into three layers of rules-in-use: operational choice, collective choice, and constitutional choice rules [(Rahman et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.758). This hierarchy has been applied across numerous case studies and has consistently demonstrated linkages between insufficient inter-institutional interactions and resource management failures [(Rahman et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.758). The framework has been adapted for analyzing multi-stakeholder platforms (MSPs), with researchers developing modified versions that incorporate principles from sustainable livelihoods approaches and resilience theory [(Ratner et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.276) [(Ratner et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-13168-270202). These adaptations allow exploration of questions of equity, power, and stakeholder dynamics in comparative analysis, focusing on designing for context and implementing processes for inclusion [(Ratner et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-13168-270202). Researchers have also adapted the IAD framework to understand collective action patterns in geographical indication registration processes [(Edelmann et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5334/ijc.968) [(Quinones-Ruiz et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.529). Additionally, the framework has been used as an analytical component in the rational-choice tradition to analyze policy development across multiple levels, examining how patterns of interactions and decisions shape outcomes with different payoffs for participating actors [(Mendez et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01258-0).

## Specific Applications and Case Studies

**Summary:** The IAD framework has been applied across diverse geographical contexts and sectors, from analyzing transnational forest certification processes in Canada, Sweden, and Russia to examining land governance in China and Vietnam. These case studies demonstrate the framework's adaptability to different scales and governance challenges. (5 sources)

Recent applications of the IAD framework demonstrate its versatility across different geographical contexts and governance scales. Researchers have used the framework to analyze transnational private sustainability governance initiatives, including a systematic assessment of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standard-setting processes regarding biodiversity indicators in Canada, Sweden, and Russia [(Elbakidze et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-12778-270109). This application extends the framework beyond its traditional focus on local common-pool resources to examine multi-national governance processes. In Asia, the IAD framework has been adapted to analyze land governance systems, with Chinese scholars developing a refined "context-structure-behavior-outcome" analytical framework based on IAD principles to examine the complex mechanisms of land governance in China [(Chen et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13040543). The framework has also been applied to understand land-tenure reforms implemented since the 1980s in northern Vietnam, where researchers used a revised conceptualization of the IAD framework to analyze how contextual factors affect institutional design and outcomes [(Yao et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND10040424) [(Clement et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.338). European case studies have employed the IAD framework's main categories to cluster information about actors, positions, institutional arrangements, and community attributes in various natural resource governance contexts [(Louda et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/F12040484). The framework's systematic approach allows researchers to focus on how rules and norms influence individual incentives within complex ecological-economic systems, making it particularly useful for analyzing local management of common resources across different cultural and institutional contexts [(Yao et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND10040424). These case studies illustrate how the IAD framework can be applied to examine governance challenges ranging from global sustainability standards to local land management practices, demonstrating its capacity to provide structured analysis across scales and contexts while maintaining focus on the core elements of institutional arrangements, community attributes, and biophysical conditions.
