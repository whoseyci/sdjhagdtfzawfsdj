## Background

**Summary:** Environmental governance transformation involves complex social and political processes beyond technical solutions, requiring coordinated interventions across multiple levels. Successful transformations depend on government leadership using various policy instruments to drive systemic change in sectors like water management and agriculture. (2 sources)

Environmental governance transformation represents a fundamental shift from traditional regulatory approaches to more comprehensive, systems-based interventions that address the complex interplay of social, political, and technical factors. The diffusion of green transformation innovations, particularly in landscape management and conservation, is not merely a technical issue but involves complex social and political processes across different levels and sectors [(Wallbott et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-10476-240124). These transformations are driven by technological, economic, and ideational factors, with proactive public actors—notably governments and bureaucracies—serving as key change agents [(Wallbott et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-10476-240124). State agents have various policy instruments at their disposal to facilitate environmental governance transformation, including financial signals, regulation, and communication facilitation. Specific mechanisms range from taxing pollution and accounting for negative externalities to providing research funding, infrastructure investments, sustainable procurement, cutting harmful subsidies, and implementing nudging regulations that favor green practices over business-as-usual approaches [(Wallbott et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-10476-240124). The Netherlands exemplifies this systemic approach, having pioneered comprehensive environmental governance transformation through their 4th National Environmental Policy Plan in 2001, achieving notable successes in subsystems such as greenhouse horticulture's transition from high energy consumption to energy neutrality, and water management's paradigmatic shift from fighting against water to working with water [(Meuleman et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU70912295).

## Conservation Payment Programs and Market-Based Approaches

**Summary:** Market-based conservation approaches, particularly payment programs like agri-environmental schemes and payments for ecosystem services, have become central to European environmental governance. These programs shift from traditional subsidies to paying farmers for specific environmental services, with the EU's Common Agricultural Policy serving as a major example of this transformation. (5 sources)

Market-based approaches have emerged as a dominant mechanism for environmental governance, utilizing financial incentives such as payments for ecosystem services and agri-environmental programs that reward land users for adopting environmentally friendly management practices [(Metzger et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1002/pan3.10172). Within Europe's cultural landscapes, these measures have been widely integrated into agricultural support systems, particularly as World Trade Organization agreements have compelled governments to replace direct subsidies with payments for environmental services [(Selman, 2008)](https://doi.org/10.1080/15487733.2008.11908019). The targeting of farm payments now commonly uses landscape-scale analysis to enable strategies that reconnect habitat networks [(Selman, 2008)](https://doi.org/10.1080/15487733.2008.11908019). The European Union's Common Agricultural Policy represents a significant example of this transformation, with agri-environmental measures providing payments to farmers in return for implementing practices that exceed legal requirements or standard farming practices [(Bazzan et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2023.05.002). These measures are designed at multiple governance levels—from EU-wide to local—allowing adaptation to diverse farming systems and environmental conditions across Europe [(Bazzan et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2023.05.002). Examples include reducing environmental risks through decreased fertilizer use, protecting nature by maintaining winter stubbles for bird habitat, and preserving traditional farming practices [(Bazzan et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2023.05.002). Policy responses within these market-based frameworks focus heavily on economic incentives, including better support for low-intensity farming, extensive grazing, and targeting specific conservation assemblages [(Plieninger et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-12647-260323). Some approaches suggest converting agricultural support into comprehensive payment schemes for multiple ecosystem services, incorporating tax breaks and regionally specific schemes that foster cooperation and address private landowner needs [(Plieninger et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-12647-260323). Hybrid governance models have also emerged, combining market mechanisms with community-based environmental management where users and governments share responsibilities in ecosystem services governance [(Metzger et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1002/pan3.10172) [(Sattler et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-08475-210424).

## Water Governance Transformation

**Summary:** Water governance has transformed from fragmented sectoral approaches to integrated, watershed-based management through frameworks like the EU Water Framework Directive. This shift emphasizes polycentric governance models that combine top-down legal requirements with bottom-up stakeholder collaboration across multiple scales. (5 sources)

Water governance transformation in Europe has been fundamentally reshaped by the implementation of catchment-scale governance systems, most notably through the EU Water Framework Directive, which establishes governance structures increasingly reflected in statutory documents such as River Basin Management Plans and more voluntary approaches such as river contracts [(Selman, 2008)](https://doi.org/10.1080/15487733.2008.11908019). The European Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) represents a notable example of rethinking state governance by seeking to improve and stop the deterioration of the ecological condition of fresh surface and groundwaters as well as coastal waters within the European Union, with legal obligations directly linked to ecological system boundaries and latest scientific knowledge [(McPhearson et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42949-021-00017-x). This directive demonstrates transformative impact with ripple effects across most natural resource-intensive sectors affecting water quality, as evidenced by cases where legally binding goals have strong sustainability impacts despite social and economic trade-offs [(McPhearson et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42949-021-00017-x). While the directive establishes a top-down planning and management structure for EU waters, it also seeks to facilitate public and private collaboration, innovation, and tailored solutions for reaching goals, with the EU setting overall legally binding goals that are implemented in state-level legislation and adapted to regional and local conditions through collaborative processes [(McPhearson et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42949-021-00017-x). Successful water governance transformation requires polycentric governance models that involve different stakeholders working at different levels and scales while incorporating cross-sectoral interests [(Terrisse et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-025-02132-2) [(Termeer et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03798-150429). The EU has identified polycentric governance as a driver for successful Nature-based Solutions implementation, providing clear guidance encouraging collaborative planning through different policies including the Flood Directive, Water Framework Directive and Public Participation Directive [(Terrisse et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-025-02132-2). A practical example of this approach is the Isar River restoration in Munich (2000-2011), which involved institutions and local stakeholders in co-designing nature-based solutions through intensive participatory processes, with governance decision-making led by different decision centers and interaction of different sectors at different geographical scales to increase socio-ecological resilience [(Terrisse et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-025-02132-2) [(Aude et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.15302/J-LAF-1-020003).

## Agricultural Policy Change and Innovation

**Summary:** Agricultural policy transformation in Europe has shifted from traditional subsidies to multifunctional payment systems that reward environmental services, with the EU Common Agricultural Policy leading this change through diverse agri-environmental measures adapted to local conditions. These innovations emphasize participatory governance, land stewardship approaches, and comprehensive ecosystem service payments that support both conservation and traditional farming practices. (3 sources)

Agricultural policy innovation in Europe has fundamentally transformed from simple subsidy mechanisms to sophisticated payment systems that reward multiple ecosystem services and environmental stewardship. The European Union's Common Agricultural Policy has undergone significant advancements, with policy responses focusing on better support for low-intensity farming and extensive grazing, targeted conservation of specific plant or bird assemblages, and general transformations of funding models to support multifunctionality, heterogeneity, and sustainability of land use [(Plieninger et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-12647-260323). This transformation includes suggestions to convert agricultural support into comprehensive payment schemes for multiple ecosystem services, introducing tax breaks and regionally specific schemes that foster cooperation and address the needs of private landowners [(Plieninger et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-12647-260323). The flexibility and adaptability of these policy innovations is demonstrated through agri-environmental measures that are designed at EU, national, regional, or local levels, allowing adaptation to local farming systems and environmental conditions that vary greatly across the EU [(Bazzan et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2023.05.002). These diverse measures encompass reducing environmental risks through decreased fertilizer or pesticide use, protecting nature by maintaining winter stubbles in intensive arable areas to provide food for birds, and preserving traditional farming practices [(Bazzan et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2023.05.002). Beyond economic instruments, agricultural policy change has embraced participatory governance approaches that emphasize land stewardship and stakeholder collaboration. Policy innovations now call for participatory approaches in natural resource management and planning, governance forms that embrace land stewardship concepts, increased citizen awareness through environmental education, preservation of traditional pastoral and farming cultures, and facilitated cooperation among land managers and broader stakeholders [(Plieninger et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-12647-260323). This inclusive approach is further supported by the widespread implementation of the European Landscape Convention, which embeds planning, protection, and management of landscapes by strengthening institutional frameworks and creating people-centered approaches [(Selman, 2008)](https://doi.org/10.1080/15487733.2008.11908019).

## Documented Examples of Successful Interventions

**Summary:** Several documented cases demonstrate successful environmental governance transformation, including the Netherlands' comprehensive environmental policy changes, Costa Rica's community-based water park management, and Germany's collaborative river restoration project. These examples show how different governance approaches can achieve environmental and social objectives through stakeholder collaboration. (4 sources)

• **Netherlands Environmental Governance Transformation (2001)**: The Netherlands pioneered systemic environmental governance change through their 4th National Environmental Policy Plan, achieving notable successes including greenhouse horticulture's transition from high energy consumption to energy neutrality or net energy production, and water management's paradigmatic shift from fighting against water through higher dikes to working with water, resulting in complete reorientation of water sector investments [(Meuleman et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU70912295) • **Juan-Castro-Blanco National Water Park, Costa Rica**: This case demonstrates successful integration of environmental conservation with social water needs through collaborative governance between public agencies, private sector organizations, and community groups.

## Governance Innovation Mechanisms

**Summary:** Successful environmental governance transformation relies on diverse mechanisms including financial instruments, regulatory tools, and collaborative approaches that combine top-down policy frameworks with bottom-up stakeholder participation. These innovations emphasize polycentric governance models where multiple actors across different scales share responsibilities and co-design solutions. (6 sources)

Environmental governance innovation operates through multiple interconnected mechanisms that address the complex social and political processes inherent in green transformation. State agents deploy various policy instruments including financial signals through taxation of pollution and accounting for negative externalities, regulatory frameworks, and communication facilitation, with specific tools ranging from research funding and infrastructure investments to sustainable procurement, subsidy elimination, and nudging regulations that favor green practices over business-as-usual approaches [(Wallbott et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-10476-240124). Hybrid governance models have emerged as particularly effective mechanisms, combining market-based approaches with community-based environmental management where users and governments share responsibilities in ecosystem services governance [(Metzger et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1002/pan3.10172) [(Sattler et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-08475-210424). These arrangements demonstrate that multilevel governance can strengthen community-based environmental management through horizontal and vertical interactions of actors from different societal spheres operating across at least three territorial levels, with civil society actors serving as crucial initiators of governance change and bridging connectors across scales [(Sattler et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-08475-210424). Polycentric governance has been identified as a key driver for successful nature-based solutions implementation, enabling collaborative planning through multiple policy frameworks and involving different stakeholders working at various levels and scales while incorporating cross-sectoral interests [(Terrisse et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-025-02132-2) [(Termeer et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03798-150429). The effectiveness of these governance innovations depends on aligning environmental objectives with social needs, creating partnerships between public and private sectors, and fostering community self-organization where increased local responsibility for governance functions leads to better environmental protection outcomes [(Castro-Arce et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land9040109).
