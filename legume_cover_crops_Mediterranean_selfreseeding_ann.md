## Introduction: Legume Cover Crops in Agricultural Systems

**Summary:** Legume cover crops offer unique benefits in agricultural systems through their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, reducing fertilizer needs while providing multiple ecosystem services. Their selection and performance depend heavily on local soil and climate conditions, with particular advantages in low-input systems where they can simultaneously increase yields and build soil carbon. (4 sources)

Legume cover crops represent a cornerstone of sustainable agriculture due to their distinctive biological characteristics and multifunctional benefits. These species are defined by their unique flower structure, pod formation, and most importantly, the ability of 88% of examined legume species to form atmospheric nitrogen-fixing nodules [(Hirel et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU3091452). This nitrogen fixation capability allows legumes to require minimal or no nitrogen fertilizer inputs while making this "free" nitrogen available to subsequent crops, enabling significant reductions in synthetic fertilizer use [(Hirel et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU3091452). The benefits of legume cover crops extend well beyond nitrogen provision. These crops contribute to reducing erosion and nitrogen leaching, increasing soil organic matter and overall soil health, while supporting climate change mitigation and adaptation [(Centurion et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13051388). Notably, legumes contribute to agricultural sustainability by releasing 5-7 times fewer greenhouse gases per unit area compared to other crops and allowing carbon sequestration in soils [(Centurion et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13051388) [(Stagnari et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40538-016-0085-1). Legume cover crops demonstrate particular value in low-to-average nitrogen input systems, where they provide the greatest yield benefits while supporting carbon sequestration goals [(Vendig et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-023-01131-7). In these systems, legume cover crops can increase yields by up to 24.3% in continuous monocrops and 11.0% in two-crop rotations while building soil organic carbon by 1.5 g kg⁻¹ [(Vendig et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-023-01131-7). The selection of appropriate legume species depends primarily on soil and climatic conditions rather than genetic variability alone, with temperate and tropical species suited to different seasonal windows and environmental conditions [(Hirel et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU3091452).

## Mediterranean Self-Reseeding Annual Legume Species

**Summary:** Mediterranean self-reseeding annual legumes include key species from Trifolium, Medicago, Vicia, and Hedysarum genera that can naturally reestablish from their own seeds. These species are particularly adapted to Mediterranean climates and show strong performance in vineyard and orchard systems. (6 sources)

The primary Mediterranean self-reseeding annual legume species for cover crop applications include: **Trifolium Species:** - **Subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum)** - A free-seeding annual legume that originated in the Mediterranean basin with remarkable geocarpism and self-pollination capabilities [(Restuccia et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/plants9111506). This species shows very promising life cycle characteristics for living mulch applications and demonstrates the ability for natural reestablishment in the second autumn [(Brandsaeter et al., 1999)](https://doi.org/10.2135/CROPSCI1999.3951369X) - **White clover (Trifolium repens)** - Shows suitable characteristics for relay intercropping systems [(Leoni et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-022-00787-3) - **Crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum)** and **strawberry clover (Trifolium fragiferum)** - Both reveal high regeneration capacity [(Tani et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms18061202) - **Berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum)** - Ensures high soil coverage [(Tani et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms18061202) **Medicago Species:** - **Alfalfa (Medicago sativa)** - Performs well in both highly productive regions and low-input systems [(Leoni et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-022-00787-3) - **Black medic (Medicago lupulina)** - Shows suitable characteristics for relay intercropping [(Leoni et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-022-00787-3) - **Burr medic (Medicago polymorpha)** - The main native legume species found in Mediterranean olive orchards, particularly in Crete [(Volakakis et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12102523) **Other Key Species:** - **Sulla (Hedysarum coronarium)** - Performs better in low-input Mediterranean systems [(Leoni et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-022-00787-3) - **Common vetch (Vicia sativa)** and **hairy vetch (Vicia villosa)** - Common vetch ensures high soil coverage, while hairy vetch shows highest biomass production and best weed suppression [(Tani et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms18061202) [(Brandsaeter et al., 1999)](https://doi.org/10.2135/CROPSCI1999.3951369X) These species are widely used in Mediterranean vineyards and orchards, where Trifolium and Medicago species commonly dominate the inter-row areas [(Ragasova et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11061073). The selection among these species depends on specific site conditions, with different species performing optimally in highly productive versus low-input systems [(Leoni et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-022-00787-3).

## Asynchronous Biological Cycles and Water Competition Minimization

**Summary:** Annual self-reseeding legumes solve water competition issues through asynchronous growing cycles that complete before trees reach peak water demand. Their early maturation in spring allows them to provide soil protection and nitrogen fixation while minimizing water competition during critical summer periods. (5 sources)

The key advantage of Mediterranean self-reseeding annual legumes lies in their asynchronous biological cycles that minimize water competition with perennial crops. These legumes complete most of their life cycle during autumn, winter, and early spring when rainfall is naturally higher, then senesce as trees enter their peak growing season [(Martins et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae10101066) [(Raimundo et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.33552/WJASS.2019.01.000511). This timing separation allows the legumes to nearly complete their life cycle just as olive trees' biological activity resumes, creating a natural handoff that improves trees' photosynthetic activity, nutritional status, and soil moisture compared to conventional tillage [(Martins et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae10101066). Early-maturing cultivars are particularly valuable in drought-prone regions because they produce adequate biomass and fix approximately 50 kg N/ha/year while competing less for water since their growing cycle finishes earlier in spring [(Rodrigues et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2015132-6252). These cultivars are best suited for dry-farmed olive orchards with low nitrogen demand in semi-arid environments where precocity is crucial for rainfed management systems [(Rodrigues et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2015132-6252). The seasonal progression creates an effective dual-mulch system. Annual self-reseeding legumes form a dense living mat covering the soil during winter and reach maximum development in early spring, providing active weed suppression [(Leoni et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10111836). Their flowering and senescence in late spring transitions the system to a dead mulch that continues weed suppression through summer while the main crop reaches peak growth, ensuring that competition for nutrients and water is minimized when trees need resources most [(Leoni et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10111836). This asynchronous approach contrasts with the challenges of winter legume cover crops in other systems, where timing mismatches between cover crop biomass accumulation and cash crop planting windows often require early harvest or delayed planting that can reduce yields [(Mahama et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.2134/AGRONJ15.0136). The Mediterranean self-reseeding system avoids these trade-offs by naturally aligning legume senescence with tree crop activation periods.

## Management Practices: Timing, Mowing, and No-Till Integration

**Summary:** Successful management of self-reseeding legume cover crops requires careful timing of termination (March-April depending on rainfall), spring mowing without soil incorporation, and integration with no-till systems. These practices minimize water competition while maximizing nitrogen fixation and soil protection benefits. (6 sources)

The critical management decision for Mediterranean self-reseeding legumes involves precise timing of cover crop termination to balance nitrogen fixation benefits with water competition avoidance. Cover crop lifetime can be extended up to April in regions with sufficient spring rainfall, but should be terminated by the end of March at the latest in drier areas to prevent water competition with olive trees [(Chatzistathis et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE11080692). This timing consideration is essential because cover crop competition for water, especially in early spring, becomes a limiting factor for main crop production in arid and semi-arid regions [(Kocira et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10090394) [(Blanco-Canqui et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.2134/AGRONJ15.0086). **Mowing Practices** The preferred termination method involves mowing grove vegetation during spring without incorporating the material into the soil [(Chatzistathis et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE11080692). This approach maintains the dead mulch benefits while allowing natural reseeding for the following season. When selecting cover crop species, attention should be paid to their faster growth and shorter vegetation period compared to main plants to minimize competition for light and other resources [(Kocira et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10090394). **No-Till Integration** The use of no-tillage systems combined with cover crops between rows in perennial crops is steadily increasing across Mediterranean areas [(Chatzistathis et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE11080692). In no-till systems, herbicides are particularly used to terminate cover crops, though the mowing approach offers a more sustainable alternative [(Kocira et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10090394). Legume cover crops serve as a key component for developing feasible organic vegetable no-till systems, with species like squarrose clover stimulating crop growth, nitrogen content and uptake regardless of tillage system [(Chehade et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13082027). **Seeding and Mixture Management** Traditional practices involving 40% winter soil coverage by spontaneous vegetation are being enhanced through deliberate seeding combinations of 100 kg ha⁻¹ leguminous crops plus 10 kg ha⁻¹ of Avena sativa seeds applied in November or December [(Chatzistathis et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE11080692). In legume-grass mixtures, grasses enhance soil nitrogen retention and provide additional functions like weed suppression, while competition for soil nitrogen actually increases legume nitrogen fixation rates as legumes respond by allocating more energy to the nitrogen-fixing process [(Bressler et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4428). The transition from monoculture to intercropping systems with self-reseeding winter annual legumes requires investment in experience and research to develop economically acceptable, ecologically sustainable, and technologically practicable management approaches [(Nin et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.5772/62338).
