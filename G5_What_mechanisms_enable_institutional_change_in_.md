**Research Query:** G.5 What mechanisms enable institutional change in agricultural and natural resource governance, and what barriers must be overcome?

---

## Introduction and Context

**Summary:** Agricultural and natural resource governance faces complex institutional challenges that require coordinated change across multiple levels and stakeholders. Effective institutional change depends on understanding both the mechanisms that enable transformation and the barriers that resist it. (LLM Memory)

Institutional change in agricultural and natural resource governance occurs within complex systems where formal rules, informal norms, and organizational structures interact across local, national, and global scales . These governance systems must adapt to evolving challenges including climate change, resource scarcity, population growth, and shifting market demands while balancing competing interests of diverse stakeholders . The process of institutional change involves transforming how decisions are made, resources are allocated, and power is distributed within agricultural and natural resource systems . Understanding institutional change requires examining both the formal mechanisms like policy reforms and legal frameworks, as well as informal processes such as social learning, network building, and cultural shifts . Success in institutional change often depends on alignment between different governance levels and the ability to overcome entrenched interests, resource constraints, and coordination challenges that maintain the status quo .

## Mechanisms Enabling Institutional Change

**Summary:** Institutional change in agricultural and natural resource governance is enabled through diverse mechanisms including incremental legal reforms, multi-stakeholder platforms, polycentric governance structures, social capital building, and adaptive management approaches that build bridges between existing and new institutional arrangements. (14 sources)

Several key mechanisms enable institutional change in agricultural and natural resource governance systems. **Incremental institutional reform** often proves more feasible than major legal overhaul, requiring enhanced capacity for conflict resolution and meaningful stakeholder participation in knowledge generation and decision-making processes [(Chaffin et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-06824-190356) [(Cosens et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU6042338). This approach focuses on building "bridges" from current governance structures rather than attempting complete system replacement. **Multi-stakeholder platforms and collaborative governance** serve as critical mechanisms for facilitating institutional change by bringing diverse actors together in structured dialogue, revealing power asymmetries, and creating shared ownership of solutions [(Ratner et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-13168-270202). These platforms complement other change strategies and can lead to broader institutional reconfigurations beyond individual projects [(Zinngrebe et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-020-00840-8). **Polycentric governance arrangements** enable change through multiple, overlapping decision-making centers that maintain some autonomy while participating in cross-scale linkages for deliberation and learning [(Garrick et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-13337-270402) [(Naito et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-021-01081-z). These systems allow for institutional diversity and adaptive capacity while creating pathways for new voices and innovative approaches to emerge [(Day et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-021-01041-7) [(Carlisle et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1111/PSJ.12212). **Social capital and community-based mechanisms** play crucial roles in enabling institutional change, particularly when communities possess strong social networks that can absorb external support and enforce new rules collectively [(Chai et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.851). Legitimacy of new institutions often depends on conservation knowledge, autonomous decision-making capacity, and recognition by relevant authorities [(Lopez-Sandoval et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-19-00007.1). **Knowledge integration and learning platforms** enable change by creating spaces for dialogue between formal institutions and informal knowledge networks, breaking down silos between research organizations, practitioners, and policymakers [(Chebrolu et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13116076). These mechanisms support institutional innovations that can break path-dependence through collaborative approaches addressing multiple issues simultaneously. **Adaptive and participatory approaches** facilitate institutional change by building trust and momentum through technical improvements before addressing deeper governance constraints, allowing stakeholders to develop confidence in collaborative processes [(Apgar et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-08929-220109) [(Ratner et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-06043-180459). Success depends heavily on leadership qualities and sustained alignment with resource management objectives. **Integration of existing institutions** rather than creating entirely new mechanisms often proves most effective, utilizing existing networks while intentionally building bridges between them to form new connections [(Zinngrebe et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-020-00840-8). This approach leverages shadow networks of actors who share values and can be mobilized to stimulate change across different scales and contexts [(Eakin et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-09831-220432).

## Barriers to Institutional Change

**Summary:** Institutional change in agricultural and natural resource governance faces significant barriers including path dependence that locks in existing systems, governance fragmentation across scales and sectors, power imbalances that resist redistribution, and the high costs of transitioning from established arrangements. (13 sources)

**Path dependence and system lock-in** represent major barriers to institutional change, where prevailing institutional, infrastructural, technological, and behavioral arrangements obstruct change and make the cost of reversal very high [(Naito et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-021-01081-z) [(Pierson, 2000)](https://doi.org/10.2307/2586011). These dynamics create institutional inertia that makes it difficult to overcome the path-dependent effects of older regimes like industrial agriculture [(Akamani, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11081564). **Governance fragmentation and coordination challenges** create substantial barriers across multiple dimensions. Most policies addressing resource management remain fragmented and target specific drivers in isolation, lacking overarching national narratives and leading to siloed responses with competing targets [(Akhtar-Schuster et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0298855). This fragmentation manifests in the absence of functioning inter-ministerial communication arrangements, lack of integration between national and subnational policies, and insufficient engagement between stakeholders at different scales [(Djenontin et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10040906). Complex policy networks face particular challenges in contexts where formal central states are too weak to effectively administer traditional regulatory programs [(Coleman, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.17528/cifor/007503). **Power dynamics and distributive conflicts** pose fundamental barriers that are often overlooked in apolitical institutional approaches. Beneath seemingly biophysical challenges lie incentive structures and social dynamics that create collective action dilemmas requiring explicit recognition of the distributive nature of the status quo and the redistributive nature of change efforts [(German, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.852). Without proactive efforts to surface divergent interests and foster negotiations around redistributive options, innovation costs become too high, hindering problem resolution. **Structural and procedural barriers** limit meaningful participation and effective governance implementation. These include prescriptive top-down measures that diminish customary governance arrangements, structural institutional barriers that exclude individuals or groups from governance processes, and insufficient governance resources and capacities [(Hejnowicz et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14063199). Institutional mismatches across scales, where correspondence between institutions and their appropriate level of authority or issues is lacking, create additional implementation challenges. **Resource and capacity constraints** significantly impede institutional change efforts. Key barriers include insecure land tenure systems that prevent investment in new approaches, insufficient extension and climate information services, limited access to credit and inputs, and fragmented institutional support [(Olabanji et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/world6020051) [(Jaisridhar et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2025.1598908). The introduction of new cost structures, such as membership and irrigation fees replacing traditional non-monetary contributions, can create additional barriers when participants are unwilling or unable to bear these transition costs [(Allasiw et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU9050755). **Political instability and policy reversals** create uncertainty that undermines institutional change efforts. The vagaries of national politics can lead to recentralization of control, reversing decentralized governance initiatives and undermining established collaborative arrangements [(Agrawal et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2014.10.001). Current lack of government action on conservation and sustainable land management policies, combined with missing frameworks for accountability, creates enabling environments that resist change [(Rodorff et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11164303).

## Specific Strategies and Interventions

**Summary:** Successful institutional change requires targeted interventions including land tenure reforms, multi-stakeholder platforms, capacity building programs, certification schemes, and policy reforms that address specific barriers while building on existing institutional foundations. (13 sources)

### Land and Resource Access Reforms - **Land tenure security mechanisms** including clear and stable land and water rights, incorporation of customary and traditional use rights into national legislation, and protection of common property systems [(Molen, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00396265.2015.1137159) - **Equitable access provisions** to land and natural resources as both a social justice mechanism and incentive for long-term investments in soil, biodiversity and ecosystem services [(Barrios et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/26395916.2020.1808705) [(Anderson et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su11195272) ### Multi-Stakeholder Governance Platforms - **Local dialogue spaces** such as departmental roundtables (Board for Forest Protection and Water Protection) led by community organizations to promote regular dialogue between public sector, private sector, and civil society [(Eufemia et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21622671.2021.1941231) - **Policy and legal reforms** to clarify resource tenure, enable collective action among small-scale producers, strengthen both statutory and traditional conflict resolution mechanisms, and proactively address inequalities in natural resource access [(Ratner et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.768) ### Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening - **Collective action capacity building** embedded in broader reconciliation processes and promoting conflict prevention through strengthened institutions [(Ratner et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.768) - **Education and inclusion programs** focusing on gender and youth inclusion in natural resource use and management, and culture of peace initiatives [(Eufemia et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21622671.2021.1941231) - **Institutional innovations** for land tenure security, financial and services access, risk mitigation and management, and efficient input markets [(Pangaribowo et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-25718-1_3) ### Market-Based and Certification Mechanisms - **Sustainability standards and certification** including roundtables linked to certification mechanisms (soybean and oil palm roundtables) and industry commitments to avoid goods from illegally converted forestlands [(Pacheco, 2012)](https://doi.org/10.17528/CIFOR/003776) - **Fair trade and value-added schemes** designed to help local producers achieve better trading conditions and encourage local entrepreneurial capacities [(Eufemia et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21622671.2021.1941231) - **Territorial market branding** of agroecological produce to reward agricultural management that enhances regenerative production [(Barrios et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/26395916.2020.1808705) [(Wezel et al., 2009)](https://doi.org/10.1051/agro/2009004) ### Legal and Regulatory Interventions - **Traditional institution integration** working through existing social norms and local by-laws, as demonstrated in Niger where advocacy created shifts in justice administration regarding tree exploitation rights [(Rosenstock et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2019.10.017) [(Sendzimir et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-04198-160301) - **Law enforcement strengthening** to increase land tenure security, strengthen formal judicial systems, and end land speculation [(Eufemia et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21622671.2021.1941231) ### Climate and Risk Management Strategies - **Flexible governance systems** that foster adaptability and coordination between centralized regulations with decentralized planning, management and services [(Balaghi et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.PROENV.2010.09.020) - **International cooperation mechanisms** for climate-related risk prevention and management, moving beyond local focus [(Calicioglu et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11010222) ### Systemic Reform Approaches - **Gradual institutional redesign** as demonstrated by the 2008 food crisis reforms of the Committee on Food Security with its high-level panel of experts [(Braun et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1111/rode.12261) - **Comprehensive governance improvements** addressing financing for inclusive agriculture development, employment and migration, multilateral trading regimes, and open data systems for decision-making [(Calicioglu et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11010222)

## Governance Frameworks and Approaches

**Summary:** Effective governance frameworks for agricultural and natural resource management require people-centered, adaptive approaches that integrate existing institutions across multiple scales rather than creating entirely new mechanisms. Successful frameworks emphasize polycentric governance structures, multi-stakeholder collaboration, and institutional matching across scales while addressing power imbalances. (13 sources)

**People-centered and adaptive governance approaches** form the foundation for successful agricultural and natural resource management. Effective governance systems must be people-centered, adaptable to local contexts and needs, engage stakeholders across different scales and sectors, and remain flexible to incorporate local practices and evolving conditions over time [(Djenontin et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10040906). However, governance is deeply embedded in culture and behavior as much as in legal statutes, making strengthening it a complex task that requires addressing the two-way influence between governance and tenure security [(Djenontin et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10040906). **Multi-stakeholder planning and climate-smart landscape governance** require specific institutional mechanisms to succeed at scale. Implementation demands multi-stakeholder planning, supportive landscape governance and resource tenure, spatially-targeted investment, and tracking multiple dimensions of change to determine if social, economic, ecosystem and climate goals are being met [(Scherr et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1186/2048-7010-1-12). Achieving these initiatives widely requires strengthened technical capacities, institutions and political support across all these domains [(Scherr et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1186/2048-7010-1-12). **Collaborative networked governance approaches** offer potential for overcoming challenges in large-scale restoration and natural resource management by aligning the work of many different institutions with overlapping objectives [(Pistorius et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3390/F5030482). Complex policy networks that incentivize cooperation among diverse stakeholders are essential, as traditional policy approaches with oversimplified prescriptions like decentralization or privatization cannot effectively deal with complex natural resource management problems [(Coleman, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.17528/cifor/007503). This approach proves especially important where formal central states are too weak to effectively administer traditional regulatory programs [(Coleman, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.17528/cifor/007503). **Integration of existing institutional structures** represents the most promising strategy rather than building entirely new mechanisms. Facilitating integration of existing institutions in related sectors like forestry and agriculture, along with local governance structures, proves more effective than creating new systems [(Zinngrebe et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-020-00840-8). Multi-sector, multi-level collaboration becomes essential for landscape approach implementation, where the management of inevitable land-use conflicts determines whether they can be converted into sustainable change and learning processes [(Zinngrebe et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-020-00840-8) [(Sanginga et al., 2007)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-01847-120106). **Adaptive governance institutions** provide frameworks for coordinating different institutional mechanisms to facilitate information and resource mobilization, economic and non-economic incentives, and participation opportunities essential for climate-smart agricultural practices [(Akamani, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11081564). The nested institutional structure of adaptive governance can help overcome power imbalances that constitute sources of social inequity by offering opportunities to utilize formal and informal institutional mechanisms across social groups and allocating decision-making authority at appropriate levels starting from the local level [(Akamani, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11081564) [(Leach et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1017/sus.2018.12). **Institutional matching and holistic governance** prove critical for effective implementation. Matching actors, resources, and legal and administrative arrangements across scales is essential for effective common pool resource management, while institutional matching - the correspondence between institutions and their appropriate level of authority or issues - represents a common challenge that must be overcome [(Hejnowicz et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14063199). Holistic governance that combines and streamlines legislation, regulation, and informal rules across scales is essential for effective natural resource governance [(Hejnowicz et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14063199). **Polycentric governance systems** offer superior arrangements for natural resource management through their flexibility, adaptivity, and inclusiveness. These systems feature multiple overlapping decision-making centers with autonomy, diverse institutions, cross-scale linkages for deliberation and learning, and processes that account for cooperation, competition, and conflict resolution [(Garrick et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-13337-270402) [(Marshall, 2007)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.50). Powerful local institutions combined with regional coordinating institutions create effective arrangements, though effectiveness remains context-dependent [(Lovelock et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2024.0648). Governance improvements through processes that reduce power imbalances require mechanisms like co-investigation of power distribution, reducing domination opportunities, engaging vulnerable community members, and establishing transparent grievance processes [(Lovelock et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2024.0648) [(Dencer-Brown et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-022-01723-1).

## Case Examples and Lessons Learned

**Summary:** Real-world cases demonstrate that successful institutional change often emerges through community-driven processes that build on existing social capital, integrate traditional and formal institutions, and adapt incrementally to external pressures. However, cases also reveal how political instability and rushed implementation can undermine governance improvements. (15 sources)

**Community-based water governance in China** provides compelling evidence of how strong social capital enables institutional adaptation to climate challenges. When faced with climate anomalies, a water management system achieved robustness through institutional change by collectively revising investment, maintenance, and water distribution rules while developing new enforcement mechanisms [(Chai et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.851). The community's strong social capital based on lineage events enabled them to absorb external power from local government, internalize it, and efficiently enforce incremental rule changes, demonstrating how communal management can remain consistent while adapting institutions to external disturbances [(Chai et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.851). **Niger's tree regeneration success** illustrates how working through traditional institutions tied to social norms can serve a catalytic role for change. Advocacy and awareness created shifts in local by-laws and justice administration, with populations coming to consider illegitimate tree exploitation as theft, while 2004 national legislation granted farmers economic rights to trees they protected on their land [(Rosenstock et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2019.10.017). These institutional alignments contributed to tree regeneration across nearly 50,000 km² nationally, demonstrating that strengthening and aligning institutional environments often serves as a precondition for sustainable agricultural practices [(Rosenstock et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2019.10.017) [(Sendzimir et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-04198-160301). **Australian landscape management** showcases both the potential and fragility of decentralized governance approaches. Regional natural resource management bodies successfully represented community interests, connected decision makers, and adaptively managed forest-crop-grassland landscapes for multiple benefits including reduced greenhouse gases, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable agriculture [(Agrawal et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2014.10.001). However, this case also demonstrates the vagaries of national politics, as shifts in national leadership recentralized control, illustrating how political instability can reverse successful decentralized governance initiatives [(Agrawal et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2014.10.001). **Colombian páramo governance** demonstrates how institutional legitimacy emerges through conservation knowledge and autonomous decision-making. The demarcation of agricultural frontiers as territorial landmarks, authority legitimation of community committees, and legitimation achieved through conservation knowledge and autonomous decisions to control communal territory represent key factors in successful commons governance [(Lopez-Sandoval et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-19-00007.1). **Community-based conservation experiences** reveal critical lessons about the pace and quality of institutional change. Rapid implementation can lead to insufficient time for building institutional capacity, resulting in negative socioeconomic and environmental impacts as communities struggle to balance poverty alleviation and environmental protection [(Kudalkar et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/csp2.13191) [(Meijaard et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1111/csp2.189). Successful collective action depends on the level and quality of practitioner engagement with resource users to support local autonomy, with existing institutions changing through social learning, new relationships, trust-building, knowledge sharing, and conflict resolution [(Kudalkar et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/csp2.13191) [(Mahajan et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1111/csp2.299). **Agricultural innovation and knowledge systems** highlight how institutional innovations can break path-dependence through collaborative approaches addressing multiple issues simultaneously. New knowledge and experiments in sustainable transition often exist outside formal institutions among diverse practitioners and networks, requiring greater focus on creating learning platforms and developing skills for managing change in large systems [(Chebrolu et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13116076). The deficit of institutional spaces and skills to integrate fragmented knowledge across development organizations, practitioners, formal institutions, and policymakers represents a key barrier to systemic change [(Chebrolu et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13116076). **Colombian post-conflict governance** provides important lessons about institutional transitions and their unintended consequences. Local stakeholders pursuing their own interests are more likely to participate in governance processes when they can gain access to and control over resources, with institutional accountability and wide participation serving as key elements for inclusive development and community empowerment [(Eufemia et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21622671.2021.1941231) [(Murillo-Sandoval et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab6ae3). **Participatory action research approaches** demonstrate how building momentum and trust through technical improvements can create pathways to address deeper governance constraints. Stakeholders initially focus on concrete technical challenges before engaging in deeper, more critical assessments of underlying institutional constraints, with success heavily influenced by personal attributes of leaders and their sustained alignment with resource management objectives [(Apgar et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-08929-220109) [(Ratner et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-06043-180459). **Irrigation system transitions** reveal how institutional change success depends on participants' willingness and ability to bear new types of costs, particularly the shift from non-monetary contributions to membership and irrigation fees [(Allasiw et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU9050755). These cases highlight that state-reinforced self-governance can work well provided it does not impinge on resource user autonomy, with user expectations regarding costs and benefits affecting likelihood of success [(Allasiw et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU9050755). **Telecoupled systems governance** demonstrates the importance of shadow networks - existing social networks of actors who share values and can be mobilized to stimulate change across space, culture, and scale [(Eakin et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-09831-220432). Functional pressures from alterations in resource system performance provide stimuli for disparate actors to forge new institutional relationships, with cultural and economic conditions, actor agency, and political networks all playing crucial roles in enabling governance transformation [(Eakin et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-09831-220432).
