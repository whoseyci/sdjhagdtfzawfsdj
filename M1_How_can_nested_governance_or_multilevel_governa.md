## Introduction: Understanding Multi-Level and Nested Governance

**Summary:** Multi-level governance involves interactions between different administrative layers that can move upward, downward, and outward to steer toward common goals, while nested governance creates polycentric systems with multiple autonomous decision-making centers that coordinate through collaboration. These frameworks differ from traditional top-down monocentric approaches by recognizing the complex interactions between formal and informal institutions across multiple scales. (6 sources)

Multi-level and nested governance frameworks provide essential tools for analyzing complex policy implementation challenges by recognizing that governance occurs across multiple interconnected scales and involves diverse actors. Multi-level governance acknowledges that different governance layers interact with one another and may exceed state boundaries, with interactions flowing in three directions: upward to the international level, downward to the local level, and outward to civil society and non-state actors [(Roosendaal et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.18174/526060) [(Termeer et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03798-150429). This approach contrasts sharply with monocentric governance, which assumes a top-down state-centered approach to policy development and implementation across governance layers [(Roosendaal et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.18174/526060). Nested governance systems are fundamentally polycentric, comprising multiple decision-making centers that retain considerable autonomy from one another, with coordination relying substantially on collaboration between these multiple centers rather than centralized command structures [(Marshall, 2007)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.50). This polycentric approach can be enhanced through multiple nested layers that capitalize on bridging organizations linking different actors and governance levels [(Schoneveld, 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3390/F6010088) [(Ostrom, 2010)](https://doi.org/10.1080/19186444.2010.11658229). In practice, governance arrangements typically display hybrid characteristics rather than conforming to ideal-typical models [(Schoneveld, 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3390/F6010088). These frameworks can accommodate multiple governance arrangements simultaneously, including democratic representation through negotiated policy arrangements, nested institutions where policy is driven from above but multiple institutional levels work in tandem, legal pluralism recognizing both formal and informal institutions, deliberative networks with open stakeholder participation, and cross-sector partnerships involving actors with different levels of influence and power [(Ravikumar et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.17528/CIFOR/005539). The key challenge in implementing these systems involves deciding how to assign governance tasks across different levels and managing the cross-level interactions to ensure complementary rather than conflicting actions [(Marshall, 2007)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.50).

## Types of Multi-Level Governance Frameworks

**Summary:** Several distinct multi-level governance frameworks have emerged including adaptive governance, interactive governance, nodal governance, and polycentric governance systems, each offering different approaches to analyzing complex policy implementation across multiple scales. These frameworks differ in their focus on stakeholder interactions, institutional structures, decision-making autonomy, and coordination mechanisms. (8 sources)

Multiple theoretical frameworks have been developed to operationalize multi-level governance analysis, each with distinct characteristics and analytical strengths. **Adaptive governance** and **interactive governance** represent broad theoretical approaches that encompass multiple stakeholders beyond government and focus on their interactions across system scales, though they are primarily oriented toward theory-building and expert analysis rather than practical collaborative assessments with local stakeholders [(Ratner et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-06043-180459). **Nodal governance theory**, when combined with social network analysis, provides a more operationally focused framework that examines institutional structures, mentalities, technologies, and resources to understand factors that support or constrain policy implementation [(Ziervogel et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-017-2008-y). This approach proves particularly effective for understanding how to improve governance of adaptation at the local level. **Polycentric governance systems** represent the most systematically developed framework, characterized by multiple centers of semi-autonomous decision-making that take each other into account through competitive and cooperative relationships with access to conflict resolution mechanisms [(Carlisle et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1111/PSJ.12212) [(Molla et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1677-2022). These systems offer enhanced adaptive capacity, better institutional fit for natural resource systems, and risk mitigation through redundant governance actors and institutions [(Garrick et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-13337-270402) [(Carlisle et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1111/PSJ.12212). Polycentric systems can be further enhanced through **nested governance arrangements** that organize decision-making across multiple layers, requiring networks and capacity building from farmer organizations to regional policy forums [(Garrick et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-13337-270402) [(Marshall, 2007)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.50). These systems operate through four key attributes: multiple overlapping decision-making centers with autonomy, diverse institutions, cooperative and competitive interactions, and cross-scale linkages for deliberation and learning [(Garrick et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-13337-270402). **Multi-actor multilevel governance** frameworks specifically address food and agricultural systems by incorporating feedback loops between various operational levels and distributing tasks across state and civil society through dynamic processes of policy decisions, implementation, outcomes, and redesign [(Onederra-Aramendi et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40100-023-00258-7). These frameworks emphasize polycentric coordination nodes that enable self-organization and flexibility while maintaining specialized sub-units and improving connectivity between them [(Onederra-Aramendi et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40100-023-00258-7). The frameworks demonstrate particular relevance for addressing complex agricultural and environmental challenges, as they facilitate international development projects and multi-stakeholder initiatives by managing interactions between multiple actors, authorities, organizations, and sectors at multiple governance scales [(Orchard et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-016-0791-8).

## Key Mechanisms for Policy Analysis

**Summary:** Multi-level governance frameworks use several key analytical mechanisms including cross-level interaction analysis, institutional fit assessment, policy coherence evaluation, and inter-institutional gap identification to diagnose agricultural policy implementation failures. These mechanisms focus on understanding how mismatches between governance levels, scale misalignments, and coordination failures create implementation problems. (7 sources)

Multi-level governance frameworks provide specific analytical mechanisms to identify and diagnose policy implementation failures across different scales and levels of government. A fundamental mechanism involves analyzing **cross-level and cross-scale interactions** to identify mismatches that can undermine policy effectiveness. Implementation may be suboptimal when attention focuses on just one single level or scale, as policies may target one jurisdictional level without sufficiently considering constraints that exist at that level or may be blind to pre-existing local dynamics that could increase policy success [(Wiegant et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104686). **Institutional fit analysis** represents another critical mechanism, examining how well governance arrangements align with the systems they aim to govern. This involves understanding the nested character of institutions, where institutions exist on several layers and the institutions on one layer provide the context for institutional rules and changes at a lower layer [(Korbee et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2019.1623014). The concept of "fit" between farm level and policy level adaptive processes can identify "misfits" that arise from gaps in adaptive governance processes at different levels, preventing farms from managing their resources effectively or delivering essential functions [(Manevska-Tasevska et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.668836). **Policy coherence assessment** provides a systematic approach to reduce conflicts and promote synergies between different policy actors and institutions. This includes both horizontal policy coherence (working across agencies at the same scale) and vertical policy coherence (working across agencies that operate across different scales) [(Singh et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.709947). When horizontal policy integration occurs across vertical tiers of governance, this creates diagonal policy integration challenges that must be managed [(Pahl-Wostl et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-020-00888-6). **Inter-institutional gap (IIG) analysis** identifies situations where there is an absence of agreed upon "rules of the game" between autonomous institutional regimes in a social-ecological system. These gaps can be created when there are unintended, unforeseen, or hidden gaps between different rule hierarchies in two or more simultaneously operating institutions [(Rahman et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.758). Finally, **functional regulatory space mapping** expands traditional policy integration frameworks by examining spaces that span several policy sectors, governance levels, and institutional territories simultaneously [(Candel et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1007/S11077-016-9248-Y). This mechanism helps identify where integration challenges arise in multi-level governance contexts and how different domains interact across scales.

## Framework Applications to Agricultural Policy Analysis

**Summary:** Multi-level governance frameworks have been successfully applied to analyze diverse agricultural policy challenges including water management conflicts, geographical indication systems, land tenure governance, and innovation adoption failures. These applications demonstrate how the frameworks can identify specific failure patterns across different governance levels and provide structured approaches for diagnosing implementation problems. (10 sources)

Multi-level governance frameworks have been operationalized across diverse agricultural policy contexts to diagnose implementation failures and understand complex governance dynamics. In **primary health care systems**, multi-level governance analysis conceptualizes governance at three levels: operational governance (individuals and providers within local markets), collective governance (community coalitions), and constitutional governance (governments and distant influential actors), demonstrating how governance failure at one level can be addressed by governance at another level [(Abimbola et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czu069) [(Ostrom, 2010)](https://doi.org/10.1080/19186444.2010.11658229). **Water management and agriculture integration** represents a particularly well-developed application area, where frameworks help explain the relationship between governance approaches and policy instrument selection. Research has shown that consensual and integrated governance approaches with joint organizational responsibilities lead to comprehensive source-based measures, while antagonistic and separated governance approaches result in effect-based technical measures [(Wiering et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12051240). **Geographical indication (GI) production systems** demonstrate how multi-level governance frameworks can explain self-organizing producer groups embedded within national and EU regulatory frameworks, helping design multi-level social learning arenas that protect product identity while managing market pressures [(Edelmann et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5334/ijc.968). **Land tenure governance** applications show how frameworks enable integrated multilevel monitoring architectures that assess structures, processes, and outcomes across different stakeholder roles, from national policy frameworks to local community experiences of tenure security [(Jansen, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12239896). **Agricultural innovation systems** use multi-level frameworks to understand limited implementation of promoted practices like agroforestry by analyzing structural elements across domains, functions performed by elements, and coordination between structures and functions. This approach identifies both micro-level failures (in physical, knowledge, and financial requirements) and macro-level failures (in directionality, demand articulation, policy coordination, and reflexivity) [(Anibaldi et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND10040386). **Policy adequacy assessment** frameworks provide systematic approaches for analyzing four interrelated dimensions of policy success or failure: target adequacy, object adequacy, instrument adequacy, and behavioral adequacy, where disruptions in each dimension can lead to policy failure with compound effects across dimensions [(Bartkowski et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-2021-16). Recent applications include **digitalization governance** in agricultural systems, where meta-governance frameworks capture the complexity of digital transformation and dynamic stakeholder interactions [(Qin et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12020297), and **networked governance** approaches that examine how multistakeholder governance evolves across countries through shared, brokered, and fragmented arrangements [(Kraak et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su16041469). **Multi-level agro-food policy analysis** has identified three main axes of tension that constrain sustainability: municipal versus regional powers, agricultural versus food policies, and rural versus urban territories. These applications suggest overcoming contradictions by mainstreaming food system approaches across administration levels and deploying comprehensive integrative policies [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399746).

## Common Agricultural Policy Implementation Failure Patterns

**Summary:** Agricultural policy implementation failures follow predictable patterns including weak coordination between governance levels, institutional capacity deficits, policy fragmentation across sectors, and inadequate monitoring systems. These failures compound each other, creating systemic breakdowns where policies designed at one level cannot be effectively executed at others. (9 sources)

Multi-level governance analysis reveals systematic patterns of agricultural policy implementation failure that occur across different scales and institutional arrangements. **Administrative and coordination failures** represent the most fundamental breakdown pattern, manifesting as ineffective administrative measures across government levels that create weak institutional operations, poor follow-up and monitoring processes, and inadequate management systems [(Ibrahim et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.6007/ijarbss/v13-i8/17693). These failures stem from improper coordination between policy actors, jurisdictional overstepping between government levels, and persistent inability to address implementation challenges [(Ibrahim et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.6007/ijarbss/v13-i8/17693). **Policy fragmentation and sectoral isolation** creates another pervasive failure pattern where different government sectors work independently without joint learning or long-term alignment of objectives, resulting in contradictory messages and resource waste [(Chinseu et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.5539/SAR.V7N4P51). This fragmentation is particularly problematic for cross-sectoral technologies and policies, where lack of coordination between ministries of agriculture, environment, and finance leads to inconsistent implementation and inability to address multifaceted challenges [(Akpensuen et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-025-01666-y). **Institutional capacity and governance deficits** emerge as major impediments where deficiencies in institutional governance become the primary reason for agricultural development initiative failures [(Cloete, 2013)](https://doi.org/10.5897/AJAR12.1604). These deficits include insufficient attention to governance structures that negatively impact innovation adoption and failure to provide adequate resources for monitoring policy implementation [(Mwambu et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.14738/abr.1112.15929). **Policy coherence breakdowns** occur when weak policy integration creates situations that drift away from main goals, generating implementation gaps and unintended duplication of activities that lead to poor service delivery [(Hlahla et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.867481). These coherence failures are compounded by **collaborative system failures** across four key dimensions: infrastructure failures in performing administration functions, institutional failures, interaction failures, and capability failures in multi-level governance arrangements [(Waeterloos, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND10050534). **Political instability and policy discontinuity** create additional failure patterns where frequent government changes lead to inconsistent policy environments, with policies initiated by one administration being altered or abandoned by successors, creating uncertainty and discouraging long-term investment [(Akpensuen et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-025-01666-y). Finally, **scale synchronization failures** occur when policies developed at national levels are not properly synchronized with local government implementations, creating gaps between different governance scales and preventing effective policy action [(Amaruzaman et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21513732.2017.1331264) [(Agung et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2014.941317).

## Analytical Tools and Methods

**Summary:** The provided references do not contain sufficient information about specific analytical tools and methods for applying nested governance or multi-level governance frameworks to agricultural policy implementation failures. Most existing analytical approaches rely on general governance assessment tools rather than specialized multi-level frameworks. (1 source)

Based on the available literature, there appears to be limited documentation of specific analytical tools and methods designed explicitly for applying nested governance or multi-level governance frameworks to agricultural policy implementation failures. The provided references do not offer concrete methodological approaches for this specific application [(Xu, 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1575719). However, several general analytical tools can be adapted for multi-level governance analysis of agricultural policy failures : • **Stakeholder mapping matrices** - Identify actors across different governance levels and their relationships • **Policy coherence assessment tools** - Evaluate horizontal and vertical policy alignment across scales • **Institutional analysis frameworks** - Examine formal and informal rules operating at different levels • **Network analysis methods** - Map connections and information flows between governance nodes • **Gap analysis techniques** - Identify mismatches between policy design and implementation contexts • **Multi-criteria decision analysis** - Evaluate policy performance across multiple governance dimensions • **Case study comparison methods** - Compare implementation outcomes across different governance arrangements • **Process tracing techniques** - Track policy implementation pathways across governance levels • **Systems mapping approaches** - Visualize complex interactions between different governance components • **Monitoring and evaluation frameworks** - Assess policy outcomes at multiple scales simultaneously The limited availability of specialized analytical tools suggests this remains an underdeveloped area requiring further methodological innovation to effectively operationalize nested governance frameworks for agricultural policy analysis.
