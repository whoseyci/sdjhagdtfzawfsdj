## Background: Conceptual Framework of Agricultural Resilience

**Summary:** Agricultural resilience refers to the ability of farming systems to absorb, adapt to, and transform in response to climate shocks and stressors while maintaining their core functions. This concept views farms as social-ecological systems with three key capacities: absorptive (coping without structural change), adaptive (learning and adjusting), and transformative (fundamental system change). (6 sources)

Agricultural resilience has emerged as a critical framework for understanding how farming systems can withstand and respond to increasing climate variability and change. Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to be disproportionately affected by climate impacts due to high dependence on rain-fed agriculture, with growing concerns that smallholder farmers may lack the necessary capacity to cope with current and future climate effects [(Africa et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3390/RESOURCES4010128) [(Holsman, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009325844). The conceptual framework of agricultural resilience treats farming systems as social-ecological systems (SESs) that incorporate both biophysical and human components [(Africa et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3390/RESOURCES4010128). This approach emphasizes the interconnectedness of ecological and nutritional functions within agroecosystems, as well as farmers' adaptive capacity and agency in mediating these functions to achieve overall system resilience [(Stratton et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2020.543914). At its core, resilience encompasses common elements including the ability to mitigate, adapt, cope, recover, withstand shocks, resist, and bounce back against disturbances [(Myeki et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/CLI9070117). More specifically, household resilience to food insecurity is defined as the ability to maintain a certain level of well-being when faced with agricultural drought and other stresses, depending on available livelihood options and the capacity to handle such shocks [(Myeki et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/CLI9070117). The resilience framework is structured around three distinct but interconnected capacities. Absorptive capacity represents the ability to show initial "persisting" responses to cope with agricultural drought through persistent coping and resistance without distinct changes to function or structure [(Myeki et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/CLI9070117) [(Khoza et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-42091-8_130-1). Adaptive capacity reflects the ability to function consistently in the face of incremental climate changes, involving learning from acquired knowledge and making adjustments for continued functioning [(Myeki et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/CLI9070117) [(Khoza et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-42091-8_130-1). Transformative capacity represents the ability to implement substantial changes in response to prolonged disturbances, including modifications to value systems, regimes, financial systems, technological systems, and biological systems [(Myeki et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/CLI9070117) [(Khoza et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-42091-8_130-1). This resilience framework connects directly to the sustainable livelihoods approach, which measures vulnerability through five classes of livelihood assets: human capital (health, education, skills), natural capital (ecosystem services access), social capital (networks and support), physical capital (infrastructure), and economic capital (income, savings, credit access) [(Vetter, 2009)](https://doi.org/10.4102/SAJS.V105I1/2.35). Households with higher and more diverse endowments of these different forms of capital demonstrate greater capacity for coping with perturbations and adapting to change [(Vetter, 2009)](https://doi.org/10.4102/SAJS.V105I1/2.35).

## Components of Resilience: Absorptive, Adaptive, and Transformative Capacities

**Summary:** The three components of resilience operate at multiple levels to enable farming systems to respond to climate shocks. Absorptive capacity involves coping without structural change, adaptive capacity focuses on learning and adjusting to maintain function, while transformative capacity enables fundamental system changes when incremental adjustments are insufficient. (8 sources)

Building resilience requires strengthening all three capacity components at multiple levels, from individual farmers to entire communities [(Asmamaw et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219393) [(Kundu et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/cli8090098). These three capacity types determine the ways and extent to which individuals, households and communities can cope with and adapt to climate shocks and their impacts [(Demisse et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e32960). **Absorptive capacity** represents the most immediate response to agricultural shocks. It highlights the ability to show an initial "persisting" response to cope with agricultural drought through persistent coping and resistance, without any distinct changes to function or structure [(Myeki et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/CLI9070117). This occurs when households are able to contend with the negative effects of climate disasters through mechanisms such as humanitarian interventions like food aid distribution [(Khoza et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-42091-8_130-1). Key elements include the use of assets, attitudes and motivation, livelihood diversification and human capital [(Demisse et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e32960). **Adaptive capacity** reflects the ability to function consistently in the face of incremental changes in climate shocks, including agricultural drought [(Myeki et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/CLI9070117). This capacity involves the ability of agricultural systems to learn from acquired or experiential knowledge and make adjustments in response to disasters for continued functioning [(Khoza et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-42091-8_130-1). It encompasses coping strategies, risk management, and savings [(Demisse et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e32960). The focus on adaptive capacity suggests using innovation and technology to adjust to climate change while largely maintaining existing approaches to agriculture and development [(Kundu et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/cli8090098). Research shows that adaptive capacity is influenced by factors including age, gender, education, land tenure security, and social networks [(Mwadzingeni et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273648) [(Siders, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1002/wcc.573). **Transformative capacity** represents the most fundamental level of change, reflecting the ability to implement substantial modifications in response to prolonged disturbances, including changes to value systems, regimes, financial systems, technological systems, and biological systems [(Myeki et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/CLI9070117). This capacity refers to the ability to change the structure and function of systems or households owing to disturbance [(Khoza et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-42091-8_130-1). It includes governance mechanisms, policies and regulations, infrastructure, community networks, and formal safety nets [(Demisse et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e32960). Climate change is likely to bring impacts where simply coping through absorptive capacity is not enough, making transformative approaches increasingly important [(Kundu et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/cli8090098). Smallholder farmers utilize all three capacities through different livelihood resources, including natural capital (land and water resources), social capital (cooperatives and family relations), financial capital (remittances and informal credit), human capital (local knowledge and skills), and physical capital (irrigation infrastructure and tools) [(Kalidou et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2406062). The integration of these local resilience mechanisms with external support from government and development stakeholders is crucial for building sustainable resilience to food security amid climate change [(Kalidou et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2406062).

## Determinants of Smallholder Agricultural Resilience

**Summary:** Multiple factors determine smallholder agricultural resilience, including livelihood assets (land, livestock, savings), diversification strategies (crop variety, income sources), socioeconomic characteristics (education, gender, age), and access to resources like credit, markets, and extension services. Buffer capacity emerges as a key mechanism that enables farmers to cope with shocks without fundamental system changes. (16 sources)

**Livelihood Assets and Resources** - **Land and livestock holdings**: Access to and use of farmlands and livestock holdings serve as fundamental determinants of household resilience [(Asmamaw et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219393). Household resilience is strengthened by the possession of livestock, which provides both income and risk management options [(Ramilan et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12040466). Land size, economic status, and social capital correlate negatively with pest and disease incidence [(Mukhovi et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40066-022-00356-7) [(Matter et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2021.645046). - **Financial resources**: Cash savings, food and feed reserves, and household composition of food and non-food expenditure contribute to resilience capacity [(Ramilan et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12040466). Access to credit significantly influences farmers' likelihood of adopting adaptation strategies, though many smallholders face financial exclusion [(Omokaro, 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soh.2025.100113) [(Abraham et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1186/S40854-018-0094-0). - **Infrastructure and services**: Access to infrastructure, land, water, and additional farming types increases households' resilience to agricultural drought and adaptive capacity [(Bahta et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08280). However, the relationship between infrastructure access and livelihood resilience can be complex and context-dependent [(Matter et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2021.645046). **Diversification Strategies** - **Crop diversification**: Diversification of agricultural systems, particularly crop diversification, improves resilience by spreading risk across different crops that respond differentially to adverse events like climatic stress or pests [(Matter et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2021.645046) [(Sallu et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03505-150403) [(Colting-Pulumbarit et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.47125/jesam/2018_2/08). Crop diversification and access to irrigation strengthen household resilience [(Ramilan et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12040466). - **Income diversification**: Diversity of income sources serves as a key determinant of household resilience [(Asmamaw et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219393). Livelihood diversification, including complementing farm income with off-farm income, generally improves resilience [(Kasie et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.26754/OJS_RIED/IJDS.252). Farmers with better access to markets are more likely to adopt high-value crops and diversify income sources [(Omokaro, 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soh.2025.100113) [(Solomon et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.32474/ciacr.2018.05.000213). **Socioeconomic Characteristics** - **Demographics and education**: Adaptive capacity is influenced by age, gender, and education levels [(Mwadzingeni et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273648). Education and larger family sizes significantly enhance farmers' adaptive capacity for better adoption of resilience strategies [(Woldyes et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.37284/ajccrs.4.2.3435). Household heads' age, gender, educational level, and farming experience determine the likelihood of adopting adaptation strategies [(Solomon et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.32474/ciacr.2018.05.000213). - **Land tenure and institutional factors**: Secure land tenure security influences adaptive capacity [(Mwadzingeni et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273648). Insecure land tenure discourages long-term investments in soil conservation and irrigation, while secure land rights incentivize sustainable land management practices [(Omokaro, 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soh.2025.100113). **Social Capital and Networks** - **Community participation**: Social capital, including cooperatives and family relations, represents important livelihood resources for smallholder resilience [(Asmamaw et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219393). Participation in social networks and cooperatives increases resilience to agricultural drought [(Bahta et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08280). Membership in cooperatives influences farmers' likelihood of adopting adaptation measures [(Solomon et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.32474/ciacr.2018.05.000213). - **Institutional support**: Irrigation committee satisfaction, access to extension services, and weather information serve as determinants of adaptive capacity [(Mwadzingeni et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273648) [(Solomon et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.32474/ciacr.2018.05.000213). **Buffer Capacity Components** - **System heterogeneity**: Buffer capacity in agricultural systems comprises access to and quality of livelihood assets, spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the system, and the presence of functional and response diversity [(Mukhovi et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40066-022-00356-7). Households with higher buffer capacity are better equipped to cope with shocks and stressors [(Mukhovi et al._1, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40066-022-00356-7) [(Matter et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2021.645046). - **Knowledge and technology**: Farmers' knowledge and behavior represent adaptive capacity within community resilience frameworks [(Nucifera et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.14710/ijpd.5.2.66-77). Agricultural practices and technology, along with climate change and variability knowledge, serve as major resilience indicators [(Wassie et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e16422).

## Drought Resilience and Water Management Strategies

**Summary:** Drought resilience strategies span from short-term coping mechanisms to long-term adaptive transformations, requiring enhanced water management infrastructure, climate-smart agricultural practices, and multi-level policy coordination. Effective approaches include water harvesting systems, irrigation improvements, drought-resistant crop varieties, and community-based adaptation measures. (14 sources)

**Water Infrastructure and Management Systems** - **Irrigation and water storage**: Allocating resources for adaptation measures such as intensified irrigation, water harvesting, and improved storage capacity for crops and water is essential [(Zenda, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e38162). Constructing small-scale dams and promoting community-based rainwater harvesting systems can improve water availability, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions [(Teku et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2024.1435138) [(Destaw et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.4102/jamba.v13i1.974). - **Long-term infrastructure development**: Prioritizing long-term infrastructure projects, such as dam and borehole construction, can mitigate the impacts of climatic shocks and enhance resilience in the agricultural sector [(Zenda, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e38162). Multi-faceted interventions that improve farmers' irrigation practices and scheme maintenance enhance resilience and adaptive capacity to climate change [(Tafula et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1080/07900627.2024.2436601). - **Water-saving technologies**: Efficient water-saving technologies in crop cultivation result in increased water-use efficiency and reduced vulnerability to water scarcity [(Tuan, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.47604/ijcs.2476). The use of efficient irrigation systems has demonstrated success in maintaining agricultural productivity under changing climatic conditions [(Teku et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2024.1435138) [(Destaw et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.4102/jamba.v13i1.974). **Climate-Smart Agricultural Practices** - **Drought-resistant varieties and conservation practices**: Farmers must be equipped with drought-resistant crop varieties and climate-smart agricultural practices [(Teku et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2024.1435138) [(Feliciano et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2022.2028597). Techniques such as conservation agriculture and water harvesting have demonstrated success in maintaining agricultural productivity under changing climatic conditions [(Teku et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2024.1435138) [(Destaw et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.4102/jamba.v13i1.974). - **Diversification strategies**: Diversified cropping systems and climate-smart techniques like conservation agriculture and agroforestry help mitigate climate-related risks by spreading vulnerabilities and improving soil health and water retention [(Tuan, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.47604/ijcs.2476). Encouraging the adoption of adaptive farming practices such as crop diversification and integrated farm activities can bolster farm income and resilience [(Zenda, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e38162) [(Abegunde et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12010195). - **Agroforestry integration**: The promotion of agroforestry, which integrates trees into agricultural landscapes, is beneficial for improving soil fertility, reducing erosion, and providing additional income streams for farmers [(Teku et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2024.1435138). Agroforestry techniques can be used as an effective part of a broader development strategy to help subsistence farmers reduce their vulnerability to climate-related hazards [(Munyaka et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su16010409) [(Thorlakson et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1186/2048-7010-1-15). **Risk Management and Support Systems** - **Agricultural insurance and risk programs**: Risk management programs can play a critical role in enhancing the resilience of agricultural systems by making more efficient use of available resources and protecting against crop losses [(Nardi et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3525146). Agricultural insurance helps rural communities better cope with the unpredictable impacts of climate variability [(Nardi et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3525146) [(Peters et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.4324/9780429457326). - **Government and institutional support**: Government and different stakeholders should enhance the resilience of smallholder livestock farmers by improving the efficiency of cooperatives, enhancing government involvement in drought and resilience activities, and strengthen communication to disseminate policies and relevant information [(Bahta, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3934/agrfood.2020.4.964). Policies dealing with drought risk reduction should focus on adaptation to agricultural drought and building of coping capacity for extreme shocks [(Bahta, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3934/agrfood.2020.4.964). **Framework for Drought Management** - **Transition from coping to adaptation**: Drought management frameworks provide evidence-based approaches to transition from coping (short term) to adapting (long-term) strategies to increase resilience to future droughts by better horizontal and vertical integration [(Holman et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2020.589871). This transition requires increased and improved collaboration across spatial, governance and supply-chain scales that develop human capital and social capital [(Holman et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2020.589871). - **Community-based adaptation**: Community preparedness for drought constitutes a sound adaptive capacity strategy, and community-based resilient approaches have historically provided local populations with unique means of survival against rising challenges [(Munyaka et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su16010409). Future adaptive capacity improvement schemes need to prioritize dry and arid regions, focusing on improvement of farmers' rural technology usage, livelihood strategy diversification, and boosting of their wealth status [(Maru et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13179764).

## Building Resilience: Interventions and Approaches

**Summary:** Building agricultural resilience requires integrated approaches that combine climate-smart technologies, institutional support, and community-based interventions. Effective strategies include engaging local governments, fostering participatory learning, promoting agroecological practices, and strengthening farmer networks while addressing underlying vulnerabilities through multi-stakeholder platforms. (12 sources)

Effective resilience building in smallholder agriculture requires comprehensive approaches that address multiple dimensions of vulnerability while strengthening adaptive capacity at various scales. The interconnectedness between climate change and development has generated increasing interest among development organizations to integrate adaptation into government rural development plans that effectively increase resilience at local levels [(Halbherr et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11101926). **Community-Based and Participatory Approaches** Community-based initiatives provide an effective approach to engage local communities in their own adaptation process and build adaptive capacity, particularly when tools to deal with uncertainty are promoted and underlying structural factors of vulnerability are addressed [(Halbherr et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11101926). Five key factors enhance resilience building in smallholder contexts: engaging local governments as partners and integrating project processes within institutional structures, considering broader landscape issues such as market access, providing farmers with incentives and support to facilitate adoption of climate-smart agriculture practices, fostering community capacity building to engage farmers in their own adaptation, and promoting adaptive management and scenario planning as tools to help farmers deal with uncertainty [(Halbherr et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11101926). Multi-stakeholder participatory platforms and simple soil-water monitoring tools have demonstrated strong evidence of building resilience and adaptive capacity [(Mdemu et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/07900627.2024.2397400). These interventions increase farmers' experimental learning capacity, expose them to diverse stakeholders, facilitate networking along irrigation crop value chains, and ultimately contribute to improved household income and livelihoods [(Mdemu et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/07900627.2024.2397400). **Climate-Smart Agriculture and Technology Integration** Significant effort has focused on climate risk management, including the promotion of climate-resilient agriculture, with efforts directed at particularly vulnerable people and areas [(Hellin et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2021.751691) [(Aggarwal et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-09844-230114). The scaling of climate-resilient agriculture depends on a combination of technologies and practices, infrastructure development, and an enabling institutional and organizational environment [(Hellin et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2021.751691) [(Glover et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0030727019864978). Government and non-governmental organizations are working to improve adaptive capacity of smallholder farming systems through increased access to climate-smart agriculture techniques including forecasting [(Amosah et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.51594/ijmer.v5i7.510). The promotion of climate-smart agricultural practices provides agro-environmental benefits and helps build resilience among women smallholder farmers without negatively impacting rural workloads [(Amosah et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.51594/ijmer.v5i7.510). **Agroecological and Nature-Based Solutions** Agroforestry, which integrates trees and shrubs into agricultural landscapes, presents a promising solution for enhancing resilience of smallholder farmers against climate variability and socio-economic challenges [(Gezahegn et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1093/inteam/vjaf061). The results highlight multifaceted benefits including improved food security, increased income, and enhanced community resilience [(Gezahegn et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1093/inteam/vjaf061). Commons-based seed production, based on collective management and ownership of seeds and varieties, plays a central role in building resilience capacities in smallholder communities [(Kliem, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-022-02844-z). This approach builds agroecological resilience by equipping farmers with tools to regain control over seed production and breeding, maintaining traditional varieties through network diversification, and strengthening adaptive capacities through self-organization and polycentric structures [(Kliem, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-022-02844-z). **Institutional Support and Infrastructure** Strong institutional support is essential for farmers to build resilience against climate change [(Chetto et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.47246/cejgsd.2024.6.2.1). Institutions including agricultural extension agencies, non-governmental organizations, private companies, and village governments play critical roles by providing drought-resistant seeds, disseminating seasonal weather forecast information, supporting income diversification activities, facilitating agroforestry farming, and ensuring access to crop markets and loans [(Chetto et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.47246/cejgsd.2024.6.2.1). Physical irrigation infrastructure alone is insufficient to build resilience and adaptive capacity; however, this can be achieved through relevant interventions that build farmers' experimental learning, expose them to diverse stakeholder networks, and facilitate value chain networking [(Mdemu et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/07900627.2024.2397400). **Integrated Technology and Capacity Building** Projects emphasizing nature-based and sustainable farming techniques such as agroforestry, conservation farming, rainwater harvesting, and indigenous agricultural practices help farming communities cope and adapt to climate change impacts while developing models for enhancing adaptive capacity in rural farming communities [(Landicho et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.30852/sb.2023.2104). Harnessing climate-smart technologies including precision agriculture, drought-resistant crop varieties, and digital innovations represents another key approach to mitigating climate risks, while strengthening adaptive capacity of farmers, particularly smallholders and marginalized communities, is essential for building resilient food systems [(Suri, 2025)](https://doi.org/10.11648/j.ijnfs.20251402.12). To minimize risks and reduce vulnerabilities, farmers are diversifying and integrating five to ten climate-smart agriculture practices in one season [(Nyasimi et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/CLI5030063).

## Livelihood Resilience and Diversification Strategies

**Summary:** Smallholder farmers employ diverse livelihood strategies to build resilience, including crop diversification, income source diversification, agroforestry integration, and climate-smart agricultural practices. These strategies spread risk across multiple activities and enable farmers to maintain functionality during climate shocks and socioeconomic stresses. (14 sources)

**Agricultural Diversification Strategies** - **Crop diversification**: Diversification of agricultural systems, particularly crop diversification, provides partial protection from risks associated with climatic stress or pests, as different crops respond differentially to such adverse events, hence buffering against total crop loss [(Matter et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2021.645046) [(Sallu et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03505-150403) [(Colting-Pulumbarit et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.47125/jesam/2018_2/08). Household resilience is strengthened by crop diversification and access to irrigation [(Ramilan et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12040466). - **Mixed farming systems**: Farmers employ mixed cropping, mixed farming, and integrated soil fertility management as key adaptation practices [(Amosah et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.51594/ijmer.v5i7.510). These diversified cropping systems and climate-smart techniques like conservation agriculture and agroforestry help mitigate climate-related risks by spreading vulnerabilities and improving soil health and water retention [(Tuan, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.47604/ijcs.2476). - **Climate-smart agriculture practices**: To minimize risks and reduce vulnerabilities, farmers are diversifying and integrating five to ten climate-smart agriculture practices in one season [(Nyasimi et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/CLI5030063). These include planting early-maturing plants and drought-tolerant crops, altering planting dates, and implementing irrigation practices [(Shikwambana et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/conservation2030029). **Income and Livelihood Diversification** - **Off-farm income generation**: Livelihood strategies such as complementing farm income with off-farm income generally improve resilience by spreading risk [(Matter et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2021.645046) [(Sallu et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03505-150403). Farmers engage in non-farming activities as part of their adaptation to changing weather patterns [(Shikwambana et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/conservation2030029). - **Piecework and alternative employment**: To mitigate climate shocks, farmers and households engage in multiple strategies including piecework employment alongside adjusting seed selection, planting dates, and other cultivation techniques [(Giroux et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228021). - **Diverse agricultural and economic structures**: Diversifying agricultural and economic structures is essential for reducing reliance on rain-fed agriculture and mitigating the adverse effects of climatic shocks through introducing diverse agricultural practices such as crop rotation, mixed farming, and adopting drought-resistant varieties [(Nardi et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3525146) [(Peters et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.4324/9780429457326). **Agroforestry and Tree-Based Systems** - **Integrated agroforestry systems**: Agroforestry, which integrates trees and shrubs into agricultural landscapes, presents a promising solution for enhancing the resilience of smallholder farmers against climate variability and socio-economic challenges, with multifaceted benefits including improved food security, increased income, and enhanced community resilience [(Gezahegn et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1093/inteam/vjaf061). - **Indigenous agroforestry contributions**: Indigenous agroforestry systems incorporating tree species like Eucalyptus globulus, Faidherbia albida, and Acacia decurrens contribute substantially to household income, accounting for 34.35% through timber, fodder, and ecosystem services such as soil fertility enhancement and water retention [(Woldyes et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.37284/ajccrs.4.2.3435). **Adaptive Management Approaches** - **Ecological versus economic strategies**: Farmers using ecological adaptation strategies such as cover cropping and agroforestry had significantly higher levels of agroecosystem functioning and resilience than farmers who were coping with shocks by working off-farm or renting land from plantations [(Stratton et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2020.543914). - **Risk management and insurance**: Risk management programs can play a critical role in enhancing the resilience of agricultural systems by making more efficient use of available resources and protecting against crop losses, with agricultural insurance helping rural communities better cope with the unpredictable impacts of climate variability [(Nardi et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3525146). - **Seasonal gardening and improved varieties**: Dry season gardening and improved variety cultivation serve as major resilience strategies among women smallholder farmers, with improved legume varieties helping build adaptive capacity and resilience to drought while increasing crop yield [(Amosah et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.51594/ijmer.v5i7.510).
