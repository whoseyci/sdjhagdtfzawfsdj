**Research Query:** 6.2.11 What coordination challenges exist between different levels of government (EU, national, regional, local) in implementing agricultural sustainability policies in Spain?

---

## Background: Multi-Level Governance Framework

**Summary:** Spain's agricultural sustainability policies operate within a complex multi-level governance system spanning EU, national, regional, and local levels, where achieving vertical coordination faces inherent structural challenges. These challenges stem from the difficulty of aligning diverse priorities and capacities across different government levels, often leading to policy incoherence and implementation gaps. (2 sources)

The implementation of agricultural sustainability policies in Spain occurs within a multi-level governance framework that spans from European Union directives down to local municipal actions. This complex institutional arrangement presents significant vertical integration challenges, as different levels of government must coordinate policies and programs while maintaining their respective autonomies and addressing distinct priorities [(Bejakovic, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3326/PSE.42.4.5). Agricultural sustainability policies, like many sustainable development initiatives, inherently require coordination across multiple governance levels and sectors, as they simultaneously address environmental protection (such as soil and water conservation), economic viability of farming operations, and social objectives like rural development [(Meuleman, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13115914). The challenge is particularly acute because local authorities often have autonomy to decide their own priorities, which may not always align with higher-level sustainability objectives, especially when local political considerations favor short-term economic gains over long-term environmental benefits [(Bejakovic, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3326/PSE.42.4.5). The multi-level nature of agricultural governance means that policy incoherence can result in governance failure with significant social, economic, and environmental costs, as effective implementation requires seamless coordination between EU agricultural policies, national regulations, regional development programs, and local land-use decisions [(Meuleman, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13115914). The institutional arrangements must enable collective action across all these levels, yet existing frameworks often struggle with the complexity of aligning diverse governmental activities and programs [(Bejakovic, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3326/PSE.42.4.5).

## Structural and Institutional Coordination Challenges

**Summary:** Spain's agricultural governance suffers from fragmented competencies and segregated departmental structures that create coordination failures between government levels. The lack of integrated approaches and clear distribution of powers leads to missed opportunities and ineffective policy implementation across agricultural and food systems. (5 sources)

The structural organization of Spain's government creates fundamental barriers to effective coordination in agricultural sustainability policies. Governmental action is segmented between sectorial departments and levels of government, a situation which contributes to inefficiency due to conflicting mandates and lack of coordination, making it difficult to articulate different objectives with regard to agricultural production, natural resources management, and employment creation in order to address complex situations and support sustainable local development [(Losch, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2022.862249). This fragmentation is compounded by the absence of a comprehensive and integrated approach that involves all relevant actors, which often limits the effectiveness of programs and initiatives aimed at promoting territorial cohesion and sustainability [(Chamusca, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su15086890). The fragmentation of competencies and changes in governmental structure represents a major constraint to policy coordination. As one regional official noted, there is a lack of common work between different Regional Departments to be able to work together within their sphere and jurisdiction, as it is quite segregated, leading to missed possibilities because resources are not channeled well [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399746). This structural problem is particularly evident in the distribution of agri-food system competencies, where the dispersion of responsibilities among different levels of administration requires multi-level coordination actions that are difficult to achieve without clear political leadership [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21683565.2025.2456946) [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399746). The inadequate coordination between national, regional, and local levels represents the greatest challenge in implementing necessary measures, with municipal policymakers often expecting no support from supramunicipal administration and rarely mentioning national administration as a relevant partner [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399746). This coordination failure is particularly pronounced in Spain, where the lack of cooperation between urban municipalities and between different levels of governance exacerbates implementation challenges [(Jubany et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.12688/openreseurope.19221.2).

## Policy Implementation and Coherence Issues

**Summary:** Policy implementation failures stem from poor coordination between different institutional bodies and policy sectors, leading to contradictory objectives and fragmented approaches. The flexibility given to Member States in implementing EU agricultural policies creates uneven implementation and reduces effectiveness at local levels. (7 sources)

The implementation of agricultural sustainability policies in Spain faces significant coherence challenges due to the complex institutional architecture governing water and agriculture areas. The EU policy framework itself suffers from coherence problems, as the lack of coordination between different institutional bodies promoting measures undermines effective implementation [(Campling et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142971). This is compounded by the fact that coordination between different policy sectors and jurisdictional levels has often proved inadequate, with biodiversity governance having little impact on other policies influencing economic activity and land use, such as the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP), transport, planning, or energy policies [(Paloniemi et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.3897/NATURECONSERVATION.2.3144). The flexibility built into EU agricultural and environmental legislation creates additional implementation challenges. EU agri-environmental legislation allows each Member State to determine its own norms, specifying standards and designated areas, which gives rise to very different interests being expressed by different social actors and very varied methods of implementation for agri-environmental measures [(Mazorra, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3989/egeogr.2000.i239.532). In Spain's case, this flexibility has led to uneven regional implementation, where only 6 of 66 regional programs had been developed and implemented by the end of 1998, with local effectiveness reduced by scheme factors including the lack of policy coordination and competition from other CAP financial measures [(Mazorra, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3989/egeogr.2000.i239.532). The coordination challenges extend to specific policy areas where multiple levels of government must work together. The implementation and monitoring of policies to support agroecology are largely dependent on coordination that is currently difficult to establish between different actors and levels: between social movements supporting alternative models and agricultural institutions or public organizations, between ministries and departments, between standards institutions, and finally, between national and territorial governments [(Sabourin et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.19182/AGRITROP/00020). For environmental sustainability policies specifically, effectiveness depends on good coordination between agricultural and environmental departments at the regional level [(Fernandez et al., 2008)](https://doi.org/10.3989/ARBOR.2008.I729.162). These coordination gaps create a cascade of problems across the governance system. Several ministries, public agencies, and departments are usually involved in water policy because of the interconnectedness of different issues like agriculture and energy, thus generating fragmented policy and the inherent risks of "silo" approaches in the absence of inter-ministerial coordination. A country with fragmented policy may also suffer from contradictory targets between public actors, which may not facilitate information sharing and is likely to undermine capacity building at subnational levels [(Gupta et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-05086-180135). This assessment can be especially useful for ensuring policy coherence between different national and subnational administrative levels, and for assisting national and regional decision-makers by bridging the gap between action-based and results-oriented measures at the regional level [(Mili et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11020299).

## Sector-Specific Coordination Problems in Agriculture and Water Management

**Summary:** Water management presents particularly complex coordination challenges due to overlapping jurisdictions between national river basin authorities and regional governments, while agricultural sectors face enforcement gaps where local and regional authorities tolerate regulatory non-compliance. These sector-specific problems require specialized inter-institutional coordination mechanisms to integrate environmental goals across different policy domains. (3 sources)

Water management exemplifies the jurisdictional complexity inherent in Spain's multi-level governance system. In most cases, hydrological planning is a competence of the national government, which is implemented by River Basin Authorities, but in certain specific cases, such as Catalonian river basins and the Mediterranean Andalusian river basin, development and implementation of water policy has been transferred to regional governments in fulfillment of legal frameworks of the EU and national water policies [(Garcia, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W10101338). This division of competencies means that recovery cost instruments can be developed by national or regional authorities, or by both levels, depending on each river basin, creating potential for coordination gaps and inconsistent implementation approaches [(Garcia, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W10101338). Despite these structural challenges, some successful coordination mechanisms have emerged in water management. The Ebro River Basin Confederation (CHE) in Spain has provided a coordinating mechanism for their growing region as one of the earliest river basin authorities in the world, with their Ebro River Basin Management Plan setting the overall framework for water management and evolving under the EU's Water Framework Directive to include greater public participation and higher water quality objectives [(Moumen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.9770/ird.2019.1.4(2)). The CHE engages not only government organizations but also communities, local authorities, representatives of civil society and the private sector, such as energy producers and agrobusinesses [(Moumen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.9770/ird.2019.1.4(2)). In the agricultural sector, coordination problems manifest differently, particularly through enforcement gaps and regulatory non-compliance. A major governance issue identified in Almería's agricultural sector is the regulatory non-compliance tolerated by public local and regional administrations [(Castro et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16214097). Addressing these sector-specific challenges requires a key action to advance in a new governance model for the agricultural sector: improving internal and inter-institutional coordination for the integration of environmental goals in public policies, along with the creation of public policies at all levels that acknowledge the creation of environmental goods and account for their value, which would benefit small farmers and society in general [(Castro et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16214097).

## Communication and Stakeholder Engagement Gaps

**Summary:** Communication gaps between policymakers, scientists, and farmers create significant barriers to effective agricultural sustainability policy implementation in Spain. The disconnect between broad policy frameworks and local realities, combined with weak coordination between government agencies, research institutions, and the private sector, results in fragmented support systems that fail to address complex agricultural challenges. (4 sources)

A fundamental challenge in Spain's multi-level agricultural governance lies in the disconnect between regional, national, and international agricultural policies and the realities faced by farmers at the local level. Policymakers often rely on broad frameworks to set environmental targets, such as those outlined in the European Green Deal or the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, but these frameworks may overlook localized challenges and opportunities faced by specific agricultural systems [(Ghirardelli et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2025.113326). The effectiveness of large-scale agri-environmental policies is often undermined by spatial scale mismatch between the organizational levels of agricultural management and those needed by local ecological processes [(Ghirardelli et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2025.113326). The integration of localized insights into broader policy frameworks remains challenging due to the lack of efficient communication channels between policymakers and regional stakeholders. The disconnect between environmental policies and their implementation is often made worse by communication gaps among policymakers, scientists, and farmers [(Ghirardelli et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2025.113326). This communication breakdown creates a cascade effect where policy intentions at higher levels fail to translate into effective action at the local level where implementation actually occurs. Weak coordination between government agencies, research institutions, and the private sector often results in fragmented extension services that fail to address the complex and interrelated challenges of climate change [(Chourad et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.33545/26180723.2024.v7.i7sd.1142) [(Mirekar et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.51470/abp.2024.03.02.08). To address these gaps, stronger institutional frameworks are needed to foster collaboration between different sectors, including agriculture, environment, finance, and technology. A multi-stakeholder approach, involving government agencies, research institutions, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector, can enhance the effectiveness of extension services and ensure that farmers receive comprehensive and coordinated support [(Chourad et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.33545/26180723.2024.v7.i7sd.1142). Despite these challenges, some successful examples of stakeholder coordination exist in Spain. Networked intermediaries supporting cooperative models have contributed to industrial upgrading by aligning skills and technologies, demonstrating that effective coordination mechanisms can be developed when appropriate institutional arrangements are established [(Song et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e34787).
