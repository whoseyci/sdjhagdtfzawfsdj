**Research Query:** 7.5 How do result-based payments compare to action-based payments in terms of farmer adoption and environmental effectiveness in European agriculture?

---

## Introduction

**Summary:** European agriculture uses two main payment approaches for environmental programs: action-based payments that reward farmers for specific practices regardless of outcomes, and result-based payments that tie compensation to actual environmental results achieved. While result-based payments offer theoretical advantages in effectiveness and efficiency, action-based payments dominate current practice due to implementation challenges. (2 sources)

In European agricultural policy, particularly within the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) framework, two distinct payment mechanisms have emerged for incentivizing environmental benefits: action-based and result-based approaches. Action-based approaches provide farmers with standard payments that reflect transaction costs and income foregone for undertaking specific actions, with these payments remaining independent of the actual environmental outcomes achieved [(Delaby et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2020.543587). In contrast, result-based approaches define clear environmental objectives and offer payments that correlate directly with the degree to which these objectives have been attained [(Delaby et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2020.543587). From a theoretical perspective, result-based payments offer clear advantages over their action-based counterparts. They provide incentives for farmers to enroll the most suitable land, ensure goal attainment, prevent adverse selection, require low informational requirements for regulators, and demonstrate cost-effectiveness while promoting dynamic efficiency through innovation incentives (Bartkowski et al., 2019). Additionally, result-based schemes may increase farmer engagement and lead to internalization of environmental goals by being less prescriptive and rewarding inventiveness (Bartkowski et al., 2019). However, despite these theoretical advantages, most agri-environmental and climate measures within the EU's CAP framework currently employ action-based payment schemes (Bartkowski et al., 2019). This preference stems from practical implementation challenges, as result-based payments require sophisticated monitoring and measurement systems and are less attractive to farmers due to payment uncertainty caused by external factors such as weather influences (Bartkowski et al., 2019). Meanwhile, existing action-based schemes have shown poor performance, lacking sensitivity to local conditions and often failing to provide the intended ecological benefits due to weak evidence-based links between implemented practices and environmental outcomes on specific farms (Bartkowski et al., 2019).

## Farmer Adoption Factors

**Summary:** Farmers show significantly lower willingness to adopt result-based payment schemes compared to action-based schemes due to payment uncertainty from external factors like weather, higher perceived risks, and monitoring complexities. However, some recent studies indicate growing farmer interest when schemes are properly designed with adequate support and flexibility. (10 sources)

The primary barrier to farmer adoption of result-based payment schemes lies in the fundamental transfer of risk from government to farmers. Unlike action-based payments that provide guaranteed compensation regardless of outcomes, result-based schemes create payment uncertainty since farmers cannot be sure that specific actions will deliver particular results [(Simpson et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106688) [(Olivieri et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13126936). This uncertainty stems largely from external factors beyond farmer control, particularly weather influences and other environmental conditions that can nullify farmer efforts just before outcome measurement (Bartkowski et al., 2019) [(Olivieri et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13126936). The unpredictability of nature and farmers' limited influence on environmental outcomes has emerged as a major hindering factor for adoption of result-based contracts [(Eichhorn et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.36253/bae-14489). Farmer preferences clearly favor action-based approaches when given direct comparisons. Recent research demonstrates that farmer participation is twice as likely when programs reward actions rather than results, with result-based programs requiring approximately €20 more per ton of carbon dioxide sequestered to achieve equivalent participation rates [(Block et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-024-03787-2). The target environmental outcome also influences farmer acceptance, as farmers require significantly higher payments for result-based schemes targeting biodiversity compared to carbon sequestration, primarily due to uncertainties in biodiversity provision and monitoring [(Villanueva et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1477-9552.12573). Additional adoption barriers include administrative complexity, monitoring challenges, and exposure to public scrutiny as farmers become direct sellers of public goods [(Targetti et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.36253/bae-15862). The perceived assumption of higher transaction costs and administrative load compared to prescription-based schemes has contributed to reluctance in engaging with result-based approaches [(Moran et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-12180-260120). Low uptake also stems from lack of appropriate advisory support and uncertainties related to result monitoring [(Hagemann et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-024-02324-2). Despite these challenges, some evidence suggests growing farmer acceptance under proper conditions. Austrian farmers have shown positive inclination toward participating in result-based schemes when adequately designed [(Eichhorn et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2024.2364774). The flexibility that result-based payments provide - allowing farmers to use their experience and farm innovatively to maximize environmental outcomes rather than following prescribed actions - represents a key advantage that can attract participation [(Moran et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-12180-260120). Hybrid solutions that combine action-based basic measures with additional result-based elements within single schemes may serve as effective means to balance farmer acceptance with environmental effectiveness [(Eichhorn et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2024.2364774).

## Environmental Effectiveness

**Summary:** Result-based payments demonstrate superior environmental effectiveness compared to action-based payments by delivering actual outcomes, promoting innovation, and enabling cost-effective spatial targeting. However, most current European schemes remain action-based despite their documented poor performance and lack of sensitivity to local conditions. (9 sources)

Research consistently demonstrates that result-based payment schemes achieve superior environmental outcomes compared to their action-based counterparts. Direct comparative studies show that payment by results measures are more effective than conventional payment for actions schemes across multiple environmental objectives, including provision of winter bird food for farmland birds and pollen and nectar resources for pollinating insects in arable farming systems [(Simpson et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106688). Similarly, results-based schemes in Switzerland achieved both higher conservation outcomes and better return on investment compared to action-based alternatives [(Simpson et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106688). The superior effectiveness of result-based payments stems from their fundamental design advantage: land users only receive payment if the conservation outcome is actually achieved [(Markova-Nenova et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1111/csp2.13003). This contrasts sharply with action-based schemes, which have demonstrated poor performance in European agriculture despite slight improvements to agroecosystem conditions (Bartkowski et al., 2019). Action-based schemes lack important sensitivity to local conditions and often fail to provide the ecological benefits they are supposed to deliver due to weak evidence-based links between implemented practices and environmental outcomes on specific farms (Bartkowski et al., 2019). Result-based payments also promote dynamic efficiency through innovation incentives, encouraging farmers to identify and implement innovative conservation measures that increase the likelihood of achieving environmental goals [(Markova-Nenova et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1111/csp2.13003) [(Brady et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-021-01573-3). This innovation potential enables farmers to adopt fewer but more effective pollution abatement measures when payment is based on environmental results [(Bradfield et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-024-02027-8). A critical advantage of result-based schemes is their ability to address spatial heterogeneity challenges that plague action-based payments. Different practices prove effective in different places and management contexts, making spatial targeting essential for cost-effectiveness [(Bartkowski, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2021.04.011) [(Schroder et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2020.575466). Result-based payments naturally incentivize farmers to optimize the choice and placement of measures for maximum environmental benefit, while action-based schemes suffer from adverse selection where farmers rationally select plots based on lowest cost rather than highest environmental impact [(Bartkowski, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2021.04.011) [(Brady et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-021-01573-3). The cost-effectiveness advantage of result-based payments is substantial, as only land users with low conservation costs will implement measures, requiring lower compensation payments and achieving higher conservation outcomes for given budgets [(Markova-Nenova et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1111/csp2.13003). Action-based schemes suffer from inefficient resource use due to uniform payments regardless of varying farmer costs and lack of payment differentiation [(Olivieri et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13126936). Despite these documented advantages, hybrid approaches that combine action-based measures with result-based elements have shown promising results. The Burren Programme successfully adopted this model, with equal funding split between actions (capital works) and outputs/results, demonstrating positive environmental outcomes [(Mcdonagh, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14095569). Such hybrid systems may represent a practical pathway toward capturing the environmental effectiveness benefits of result-based approaches while addressing implementation challenges.

## Current Implementation and Future Directions

**Summary:** European agriculture remains dominated by action-based payment schemes despite growing recognition of result-based advantages, but recent policy shifts including the Green Deal and CAP reforms are promoting hybrid approaches that combine both payment types to balance effectiveness with farmer acceptance. (10 sources)

Current implementation of result-based payment schemes across Europe remains limited, with very few agri-environmental and climate measures within the CAP framework employing result-based approaches [(Bartkowski, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2021.04.011) [(Witvliet et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2322251). Most agricultural environmental programs continue to be action-oriented, with farmers receiving payments as long as they respect program conditions rather than achieving actual environmental outcomes [(Witvliet et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2322251). However, notable policy momentum is building toward result-based approaches. The European Green Deal represents a significant shift, with the European Commission progressively pushing for environmental transformation and climate action that involves stronger focus on greening policy objectives within the Common Agricultural Policy [(Pinto-Correia et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-12973-270139). This transformation entails changes toward performance-based payments that partially replace traditional activity-based payments, with the CAP foreseeing greater flexibility in national programs and tailor-made solutions centered on environmental outcomes [(Pinto-Correia et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-12973-270139). The scientific community strongly advocates for prioritizing result-based schemes, with experts arguing that result-based schemes should be given preference over the more widespread action-based schemes (Baaken, 2022). Research and pilot projects increasingly demonstrate that results-oriented agri-environment programs offer more effective means of delivering better environmental outcomes when well designed and accompanied by robust environmental indicators [(Mcdonagh, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14095569). Hybrid approaches are emerging as the most promising implementation pathway for widespread adoption. The successful Burren Programme exemplifies this model by adopting a hybrid outcome-based payment system with two main measures absorbing roughly equal funding - one for actions and another for outputs and results [(Mcdonagh, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14095569) [(Moran et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-12180-260120). Experts across Europe increasingly recognize that a combination of both result-based and action-oriented payments is likely optimal [(Pe'er et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12901). These hybrid solutions serve multiple purposes: they combine action-based basic measures with additional result-based elements within single schemes to balance effectiveness with farmer acceptance [(Eichhorn et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2024.2364774), while reducing risks of non-delivery due to external factors by ensuring farmers receive some rewards regardless of outcome variability [(Sattler et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2023.102668). The rising popularity stems from recognized advances in effectiveness over action-based measures, with Austrian farmers showing positive inclination toward participating in result-based schemes when properly designed [(Eichhorn et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2024.2364774). Future directions emphasize overcoming implementation barriers through careful design that reduces unnecessary risks to farmers while maintaining the core advantages of result-based approaches [(Pe'er et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12901). The effectiveness of mainstream agri-environmental measures is increasingly recognized as limited by action-based prescription approaches, creating momentum for result-based solutions that link payments directly to environmental outputs and increase farmer flexibility and responsibility [(Kelemen et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106706).
