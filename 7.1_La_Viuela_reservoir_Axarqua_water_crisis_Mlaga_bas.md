## Background and Context

**Summary:** La Viñuela reservoir in Spain's Axarquía region was built in 1989 to supply water for urban centers and irrigate 8,000 hectares of subtropical crops, but has faced severe crisis with water levels dropping to historic lows of 7.5% by 2024. The region became a major European producer of avocados and mangoes but experienced a structural imbalance between water demand and supply, leading to harvest losses of 80% for mangoes and 50% for avocados.

La Viñuela dam is located on the Guaro River in Málaga Province, Spain, serving as the primary water source for the Axarquía region. The dam was completed in 1989 with a capacity of 170 hm³ and serves multiple purposes: supplying drinking water to urban centers along the eastern Costa del Sol between Málaga and Nerja, irrigating 8,000 hectares of subtropical and horticultural crops, and potentially supplying the city of Málaga [(Ruiz-Armenteros et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.4995/jisdm2022.2022.13883). The reservoir's basin covers 119 km² with an average yearly rainfall of 893 mm and an average yearly water contribution of 25 hm³ [(Ruiz-Armenteros et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.4995/jisdm2022.2022.13883). The Axarquía region has become a major center for subtropical fruit production in Europe, with Spain positioning itself as a leading producer and exporter of these crops. The region hosts roughly 40% of Spanish avocado plantations (8,000 ha) and 90% of mango plantations (4,250 ha) located in Málaga Province, contributing significantly to Spain's production of 117,000 tons of avocado and 41,000 tons of mango in 2021 (Junquera et al., 2024). However, this agricultural expansion has created a chronic structural imbalance between water demand and available resources, compounded by governance shortcomings including large uncertainties in water resource planning, lack of enforcement of individual water quotas, and absence of regulatory mechanisms for flexible resource use restrictions (Junquera et al., 2024).

## Water Crisis and Drought Impacts

**Summary:** The Axarquía region experienced severe drought conditions that caused La Viñuela reservoir levels to drop to a historic low of 7.5% by January 2024, forcing authorities to cut irrigation water for the first time in the dam's history and resulting in devastating harvest losses of 80% for mangoes and 50% for avocados. (2 sources)

The water crisis in the Axarquía region reached critical levels following several years of below-average precipitation that pushed the system beyond its limits. In October 2022, La Viñuela dam's water levels dropped to near 10%, prompting authorities to shut off irrigation water supply for the first time in the dam's history and impose restrictions on urban water supply to prevent the reservoir from falling below the 8% threshold at which it becomes inoperable (Junquera et al., 2024). The situation continued to deteriorate, with reservoir storage levels remaining at critical levels below 50 hm³ since the 2019/2020 water year due to persistently low inflows since 2013/2014 [(Hurtado et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13122156). By January 2024, the dam reached a historical low of 7.5%, forcing the largest urban centers to search for alternative ground and surface water resources in neighboring regions (Junquera et al., 2024). The drought's impact extended beyond surface water to groundwater resources, with the main coastal aquifer, the Vélez, reaching the lowest recorded levels since monitoring began in the late 1990s and dropping to sea level in several locations (Junquera et al., 2024). This groundwater depletion indicates that the region's aquifers are overexploited, adding another layer to the water crisis [(Hurtado et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13122156). The combined effect of severely restricted irrigation water supply and below-average rainfall had devastating consequences for the region's subtropical fruit production, resulting in harvest losses of 80% for mango and 50% for avocado compared to the previous year, and causing important tree mortality in orchards where no irrigation water was available (Junquera et al., 2024).

## Water Balance and Supply-Demand Imbalance

**Summary:** The Axarquía region faces a structural water deficit of 10.9 hm³ annually, with total water rights of 103.5 hm³ exceeding available resources of 92.7 hm³. The La Viñuela reservoir, designed to provide 32.2 hm³ annually, has averaged only 45 hm³ inflow while committed rights total 36.4 hm³ for urban use, irrigation, and environmental flows. (1 source)

The Axarquía region's water crisis stems from a fundamental imbalance between allocated water rights and available resources that has created chronic structural deficits. According to the Hydrological Plan of the Mediterranean Basins 2022-2027, total allocated water rights for economic uses amount to 103.5 hm³, which are expected to be met through regulated reservoir resources (32.2 hm³), non-regulated surface water (15.1 hm³), and groundwater (55.9 hm³). However, these allocations exceed the available water resources estimated at 92.7 hm³, creating a deficit of approximately 10.9 hm³ that has caused significant agricultural losses and urban water restrictions since 2020 [(Hurtado et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13122156). The La Viñuela reservoir itself operates under tight water balance constraints, with average committed water rights totaling 36.4 hm³ including 11.4 hm³ for urban use, 20 hm³ for irrigation, and 5 hm³ for environmental flows and evaporation. While the reservoir's average inflow has been 45 hm³, this modest surplus has proven insufficient during drought periods, and storage levels have consistently declined due to persistently low inflows since 2013/2014 [(Hurtado et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13122156). During critical periods, regulated water resources have been almost exclusively allocated to urban and irrigation needs, requiring supplementation through groundwater extraction and imported reclaimed water from neighboring Málaga to meet demand [(Hurtado et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13122156).

## Competing Water Demands

**Summary:** The Axarquía region faces intense competition between urban supply (11.4 hm³), agricultural irrigation (20 hm³), and environmental flows (5 hm³), with Spanish water law prioritizing urban use over agriculture during droughts. Agricultural demands dominate at over 80% of total consumption, creating constant competition with urban development projects and tourism infrastructure along the Costa del Sol. (4 sources)

The water crisis in the Axarquía region is characterized by competing demands from multiple sectors operating under a strict priority hierarchy established by Spanish water law. During drought conditions, water allocation follows a clear priority system where urban use (human consumption and industries connected to urban supply networks) receives first priority, followed by agricultural uses, electric power production, industrial uses, aquaculture, recreational uses, navigation, and other uses [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12061835). Within each priority class, water is rationed proportionally among all right holders [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12061835). **Key competing water demands include:** - **Urban water supply**: La Viñuela reservoir allocates 11.4 hm³ for urban use, serving drinking water needs for cities along the eastern Costa del Sol between Málaga and Nerja [(Hurtado et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13122156) - **Agricultural irrigation**: The largest water consumer at 20 hm³ from La Viñuela reservoir, supporting 8,000 hectares of subtropical crops including avocados and mangoes [(Hurtado et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13122156). Agricultural water consumption accounts for more than 80% of total water consumption in Andalusia, creating constant competition with other sectors [(Gonzalez-Rosell et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12113172) - **Environmental flows and evaporation**: Allocated 5 hm³ to maintain ecological functions and account for reservoir losses [(Hurtado et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13122156) - **Urban development projects**: Mayors of neighboring municipalities have urbanization projects on hold because they cannot guarantee water supply for new developments [(Abadia et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W11030410) - **Inter-regional water transfers**: Málaga city seeks access to La Viñuela water, which currently serves Axarquía's needs, creating tension between regional water allocation priorities [(Abadia et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W11030410) The competition is particularly intense because agricultural businesses growing tropical crops have over-pumped their local aquifers and express urgent need for reservoir water, warning of serious economic repercussions if access is restricted [(Abadia et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W11030410). This competition between high-volume agricultural water consumption and urban/industrial demands creates a fragile water balance that climate change pressures will likely worsen in the future [(Gonzalez-Rosell et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12113172).

## Governance and Management Issues

**Summary:** The Axarquía water crisis stems from fundamental governance failures including large uncertainties in water resource planning, lack of enforcement of individual water quotas, and absence of regulatory mechanisms for flexible resource use restrictions. These structural shortcomings created a chronic imbalance between water demand and available resources that made the system vulnerable to drought impacts. (1 source)

While the immediate trigger for the Axarquía water crisis was an unusual meteorological drought that caused La Viñuela reservoir levels to plummet, the underlying cause was a chronic and structural long-term imbalance between water demand and resources resulting from several critical governance shortcomings. These systemic failures include large uncertainties in water resource availability and use that hamper effective planning, lack of enforcement of individual water quotas, and the absence of regulatory mechanisms to flexibly impose resource use restrictions at both micro and macro levels based on the overall resources of the system (Junquera et al., 2024). The governance failures are particularly evident in how the system operated during the crisis. When La Viñuela dam levels dropped to near 10% in October 2022, authorities were forced to shut off irrigation water supply for the first time in the dam's history and impose urban water restrictions - indicating that no proactive management mechanisms existed to prevent the system from reaching such critical thresholds (Junquera et al., 2024). The lack of flexible regulatory tools meant that water use continued at unsustainable levels until the reservoir nearly became inoperable, rather than implementing graduated restrictions as water availability declined. These governance shortcomings created a system where water demand consistently exceeded available resources without adequate oversight or corrective mechanisms. The result was a water management framework that proved incapable of preventing or adequately responding to the structural imbalance between the region's ambitious agricultural expansion and its limited water resources, ultimately requiring emergency measures and external water sourcing when the system reached crisis levels (Junquera et al., 2024).

## Adaptation and Response Measures

**Summary:** The Axarquía region has responded to its water crisis through deficit irrigation practices by farmers and importing treated wastewater from Málaga city to supplement urban supply. Broader adaptation strategies in Spanish Mediterranean regions include desalination, water reuse, and innovative water exchange agreements between agricultural and urban sectors. (3 sources)

**Response measures implemented in the Axarquía region include:** - **Deficit irrigation adoption**: Farmers have adapted to water shortages by implementing deficit irrigation techniques to maximize crop productivity with reduced water inputs [(Hurtado et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13122156) - **Imported treated wastewater**: Urban areas have mitigated water shortfalls by importing treated urban wastewater from the neighboring city of Málaga to supplement local supply [(Hurtado et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13122156) - **Groundwater extraction**: The region has supplemented surface water resources through increased groundwater extraction, though this has led to overexploitation of aquifers [(Hurtado et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13122156) **Broader adaptation strategies from Spanish Mediterranean coastal regions include:** - **Desalination and water reuse**: Incorporation of unconventional water resources including desalination and reuse of reclaimed water has become essential for meeting urban and agricultural demands, particularly in fast-growing tourism areas along Spain's Mediterranean coast [(Hidalgo et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/CHYCLE-2017-04834) - **Water exchange agreements**: Innovative collaboration models such as the water exchange agreement in Benidorm, where reclaimed water from urban wastewater treatment plants is supplied to irrigation communities in exchange for fresh water rights during drought situations, offer potential solutions for reducing conflicts between agricultural and urban-tourist water demands [(Ricart et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w13172431) - **Sustainable urban water measures**: Promotion of sustainable urban measures to increase resilience and create smart and sustainable cities has become necessary to address the combined challenges of growing tourism demand and climate change impacts [(Hidalgo et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/CHYCLE-2017-04834)
