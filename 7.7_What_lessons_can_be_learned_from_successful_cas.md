## Background on Agricultural Subsidy Restructuring

**Summary:** Agricultural subsidies have traditionally focused on boosting productivity and financial stability, but there's growing recognition that these programs must be redesigned to align economic incentives with environmental goals. This restructuring involves shifting from supporting environmentally harmful practices like synthetic fertilizer overuse to rewarding sustainable farming methods, biodiversity conservation, and ecosystem services. (9 sources)

Traditional agricultural subsidy systems have often created perverse environmental incentives. For example, subsidizing synthetic fertilizers, while intended as economic support for farmers, frequently leads to over-application due to increased purchasing power, resulting in environmental pollution and land degradation [(Abhilash, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND10020201). This misalignment has contributed to agricultural practices that have crossed planetary boundaries for nitrogen use. The concept of agricultural subsidy restructuring centers on redirecting existing resources to provide positive incentives for sustainable development while improving economic efficiency and competitiveness [(Borsellino et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12062193). This approach recognizes the huge potential for redistributing current agricultural spending toward environmentally beneficial outcomes rather than simply increasing overall subsidy levels. Modern restructuring efforts focus on several key mechanisms. Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) programs compensate farmers for preserving biodiversity or sequestering carbon, while government subsidies for sustainable practices like organic farming and agroecological methods show promise in promoting environmentally friendly approaches [(Adisa et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.30574/wjarr.2024.21.1.0322) [(Wunder, 2005)](https://doi.org/10.17528/CIFOR/001760). Cost-sharing programs can "crowd in intrinsic motivations" for adopting environmentally beneficial management practices, offering opportunities to use subsidies as economic incentives for sustainable land management (Chapman et al., 2017). The restructuring approach emphasizes tying financial assistance to measurable environmental and social outcomes, such as reduced carbon footprints, biodiversity conservation, and rural community engagement [(Mazancova et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1177/21582440251324756). This represents a fundamental shift from productivity-focused subsidies to incentive systems that reward practices benefiting both farmers and environmental sustainability [(Lim et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.22617/BRF210099-2) [(Mattas et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advnut.2023.03.011) [(Tamburini et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba1715).

## Lessons from Successful Cases

**Summary:** Analysis of successful agricultural subsidy restructuring reveals that effective reforms require quick action during policy windows, targeted approaches with environmental constraints, stakeholder engagement, and robust evidence-based design. The most successful programs combine economic incentives with clear environmental compliance measures and continuous monitoring systems. (7 sources)

Successful subsidy restructuring cases demonstrate several critical lessons for aligning economic incentives with environmental goals. The most effective reforms act quickly when windows of opportunity arise, often driven by external factors like economic or health crises, and build strategic alliances between economic and environmental interests [(McElwee et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2020.09.011). These reforms require targeted measures that address potential impacts on competitiveness and income distribution while encouraging broad stakeholder engagement [(McElwee et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2020.09.011). Evidence-based targeting emerges as a crucial factor for success. Well-designed programs can effectively direct resources to areas of greatest environmental need, such as regions with low soil organic carbon and high greenhouse gas emissions [(Biffi et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abfa4e). However, successful cases also reveal ongoing challenges, as clear mismatches between funding and environmental need persist in areas like water stress, biodiversity loss, and nutrient runoff [(Biffi et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abfa4e). The introduction of cross-compliance measures and environmental constraints proves highly effective in achieving sustainability goals. Programs that support low levels of production or include high shares of payments with environmental constraints successfully achieve high levels of sustainable productivity [(Bernini et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2024.108120). The EU's Common Agricultural Policy reforms demonstrate that environmental efficiency increases significantly when subsidies include greening components that reward farmers for adopting environmentally friendly practices [(Bernini et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2024.108120) [(Czyzewski et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE11010078). Successful restructuring also requires moving beyond simple repurposing to comprehensive redesign. Global restructuring approaches that combine subsidy repurposing with redistribution based on population or GDP can achieve more equally distributed environmental and health benefits while maintaining or increasing overall effectiveness [(Springmann et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27645-2). These approaches lead to comparable health benefits and similar or greater reductions in greenhouse gas emissions compared to repurposing-only strategies [(Springmann et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27645-2). Finally, effective programs require continuous monitoring and evaluation systems. Successful cases emphasize the need for targeted policies with clear environmental compliance standards, robust evidence bases on social costs and benefits, and mechanisms for incorporating stakeholder feedback to ensure policies remain effective and relevant [(Chen, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.47941/ijlp.1968) [(Ullah et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.17582/JOURNAL.SJA/2019/35.2.449.458).

## Specific Successful Cases and Their Outcomes

**Summary:** Several countries have successfully restructured agricultural subsidies to achieve environmental goals, including Brazil's forest conservation programs that saved billions while preventing deforestation, China's large-scale land conversion initiatives, and reform efforts in the US, EU, and England that shift payments toward environmental services and sustainable practices. (7 sources)

**Brazil's Environmental Credit Reforms**: Brazil has implemented notable subsidy restructuring programs that directly link financial support to environmental outcomes. A single reform linking rural credit subsidies to environmental criteria saved US$1.4 billion in reduced loans between 2008-2011, while preventing an estimated 270,000 additional hectares of forest loss that would have occurred from increased beef production [(Ullah et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.17582/JOURNAL.SJA/2019/35.2.449.458). The country's "Bolsa Verde" conditional cash-transfer program provides financial benefits to thousands of forest-dependent poor families in exchange for maintaining vegetation cover and sustainable natural resource management, simultaneously addressing poverty and forest conservation in the Brazilian Amazon [(Ullah et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.17582/JOURNAL.SJA/2019/35.2.449.458). **China's Grain to Green Program**: Launched in 2002, China's Grain to Green Program (GTGP) became one of the world's largest payments for ecosystem services programs [(Bharadwa et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1357321722000083). The program incentivized farmers to convert cropland on steep highland slopes into forests and grassland through grain and cash subsidies, with payment amounts varying by location within the Yangtze or Yellow River Basins. The program achieved significant environmental successes including reduced surface water run-off, soil erosion, and desertification [(Bharadwa et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1357321722000083). More recent reforms in China's agricultural subsidy system emphasize green objectives by redirecting subsidies from chemical fertilizers toward organic fertilizers, energy-efficient machinery, and farmland fertility protection, while investments in high-standard farmland construction enhance productivity while reducing reliance on chemical inputs [(Xia et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.15302/j-fase-2025609). **US and EU Policy Reforms**: The 2014 US agriculture act reformed price support, income subsidy policy, agricultural insurance subsidies, and resource and environmental protection subsidies [(Wang et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14031051) [(Jirapornvaree et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10098-021-02153-5). The EU Common Agricultural Policy has promoted regional balanced development by reducing direct subsidies, implementing decoupling subsidies, and establishing environmental protection subsidy systems [(Wang et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14031051). These reforms represent a shift toward "green box" policies that comply with WTO rules while achieving environmental goals [(Wang et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14031051). **England's Environmental Land Management Scheme**: England has developed an Environmental Land Management Scheme designed to financially reward sustainable farmland management for generating public goods, shifting from area-based payments to payments based on environmental management [(Reyes-Garcia et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-025-02147-3) [(Hurley et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k2ahd). Meanwhile, Zambia has developed financing options including scaling back conventional agriculture subsidies and reallocating funds to climate-smart agriculture and biodiversity conservation, while introducing penalties for subsidy recipients who purchase inputs harmful to biodiversity [(Reyes-Garcia et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-025-02147-3).

## Key Principles for Effective Restructuring

**Summary:** Effective agricultural subsidy restructuring requires acting quickly during policy windows, building cross-sector alliances, using targeted and evidence-based approaches, ensuring equitable distribution, and establishing robust monitoring systems. Success depends on aligning subsidies with sustainability goals while addressing competitiveness and social equity concerns. (2 sources)

- **Act quickly during windows of opportunity**: Reforms should capitalize on external circumstances like health or economic crises that create openings for policy change, even when these opportunities are outside the direct influence of domestic policymakers and unrelated to environmental concerns [(McElwee et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2020.09.011) - **Build strategic alliances**: Successful restructuring requires forming partnerships between economic and environmental interests to create common ground and reduce resistance to reform [(McElwee et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2020.09.011) - **Use targeted and evidence-based design**: Programs must be well-targeted to enhance efficiency and sustainability, with robust evidence bases on social costs and benefits to guide policy decisions [(McElwee et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2020.09.011) [(Chen, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.47941/ijlp.1968) - **Address competitiveness and distribution concerns**: Effective reforms include targeted measures to address potential impacts on farm competitiveness and income distribution, ensuring that restructuring doesn't harm agricultural viability [(McElwee et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2020.09.011) - **Ensure equitable access**: Subsidy programs must be designed to ensure smallholder and marginalized farmers benefit fairly, preventing larger operations from capturing disproportionate benefits [(Chen, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.47941/ijlp.1968) - **Align with sustainability goals**: Restructured subsidies should directly promote sustainable practices and environmental benefits rather than simply redirecting existing support mechanisms [(Chen, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.47941/ijlp.1968) - **Engage stakeholders broadly**: Successful programs encourage broad stakeholder engagement and incorporate ongoing feedback to ensure policies remain effective and relevant [(McElwee et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2020.09.011) [(Chen, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.47941/ijlp.1968) - **Establish continuous monitoring**: Effective restructuring requires ongoing monitoring and evaluation systems to track progress, measure outcomes, and adapt policies as needed [(Chen, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.47941/ijlp.1968) - **Promote international coordination**: Policy harmonization and international cooperation help prevent market distortions and promote fair trade while advancing global sustainability goals [(Chen, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.47941/ijlp.1968)
