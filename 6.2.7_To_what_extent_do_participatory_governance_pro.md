**Research Query:** 6.2.7 To what extent do participatory governance processes in Spanish agriculture reflect elite capture or unequal power dynamics among stakeholders?

---

## Introduction

**Summary:** Participatory governance in Spanish agriculture often suffers from elite capture, where powerful stakeholders dominate decision-making processes while marginalizing smaller farmers and rural communities. These power imbalances undermine the democratic ideals of participatory governance and can lead to policies that favor established interests over broader agricultural sustainability and equity goals. (LLM Memory)

Participatory governance processes in Spanish agriculture reveal significant power imbalances that frequently result in elite capture and unequal representation among stakeholders . While these governance mechanisms are designed to include diverse voices in agricultural policy-making, research shows that larger agricultural enterprises, established cooperatives, and well-connected industry representatives often dominate proceedings at the expense of smallholder farmers and marginalized rural communities . The Spanish agricultural sector's structure, characterized by a mix of intensive industrial operations and traditional small-scale farming, creates inherent tensions in participatory processes where stakeholders possess vastly different resources, technical knowledge, and political influence . These dynamics are particularly evident in regional agricultural councils, water management boards, and rural development planning committees, where formal participation does not guarantee meaningful influence over outcomes . Understanding the extent of elite capture in Spanish agricultural governance requires examining both the structural factors that create power imbalances and the specific mechanisms through which dominant stakeholders maintain their influence over participatory processes .

## Evidence of Power Imbalances in Participatory Governance

**Summary:** Research shows that participatory governance processes across various contexts consistently suffer from power imbalances that undermine their democratic goals. These imbalances manifest both horizontally among stakeholder groups and vertically between local participants and higher authorities, often leading to outcomes that favor dominant voices while marginalizing weaker participants. (6 sources)

Multiple studies reveal systematic evidence of power imbalances undermining participatory governance processes in rural and agricultural contexts. Power inequalities have been shown to maintain clear differences between dominant and subjected voices, impede social learning among participants, and even endanger the continuation of participatory processes themselves [(Hovardas, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13147744) [(Wallner et al., 2009)](https://doi.org/10.1553/ECO.MONT1S45). These imbalances operate both horizontally among different stakeholder groups participating in governance schemes and vertically between local participants and regional authorities responsible for implementing decisions [(Hovardas, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13147744). Critical analysis of participatory processes reveals that mainstream participation often serves as "a shroud for technologies of governance that do not address -and may reinforce- structures of inequality among participants" [(A.M. et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.17528/cifor/007593) [(Cornwall, 2004)](https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1759-5436.2004.TB00115.X). Power imbalances extend beyond simple economic disparities to include unequal access to technical knowledge and even basic invitations to participate in governance processes [(A.M. et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.17528/cifor/007593). These structural inequalities often result in agreements that rely on voluntary compliance without enforcement mechanisms or sanctions, potentially creating or worsening conflicts among participating stakeholders [(A.M. et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.17528/cifor/007593). The reality of participatory governance frequently falls short of its democratic ideals, with many initiatives functioning as "box-ticking exercises" designed to satisfy legal requirements or legitimize decisions that have already been made [(A.M. et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.17528/cifor/007593). In spatial planning contexts relevant to rural development, the expansion of participatory governance has been criticized for reinforcing power struggles among stakeholders and generating conflicts, highlighting the need for realistic approaches that acknowledge unequal power relationships and establish objective decision-making mechanisms with adequate conflict management systems [(Castro-Pardo et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land8100145). Research specifically examining stakeholder participation reveals examples of systematic underrepresentation and power imbalances, where agreements depend heavily on participants' predisposition to collaborate and their affinity with dominant groups rather than equitable representation [(Ricart et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-021-10271-5).

## Mechanisms and Manifestations of Elite Capture

**Summary:** Elite capture in participatory governance operates through subtle mechanisms that reinforce existing power structures rather than challenging them. These processes often become "box-ticking exercises" that legitimize predetermined decisions while creating the appearance of inclusive participation. (2 sources)

The mechanisms through which elite capture operates in participatory governance are often subtle and institutionalized, functioning as "technologies of governance that do not address -and may reinforce- structures of inequality among participants" [(A.M. et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.17528/cifor/007593) [(Cornwall, 2004)](https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1759-5436.2004.TB00115.X). Elite capture manifests through multiple interconnected pathways that systematically advantage powerful stakeholders while marginalizing weaker voices. Control over access represents a fundamental mechanism, where dominant groups influence not only economic and natural resources but also technical knowledge and even basic invitations to participate in governance processes [(A.M. et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.17528/cifor/007593). The agreements and outcomes produced by captured participatory processes typically lack enforcement mechanisms and rely heavily on voluntary compliance without meaningful sanctions, which can actually create or worsen conflicts among participating stakeholders [(A.M. et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.17528/cifor/007593). This creates a system where powerful actors can participate selectively in implementation while weaker stakeholders bear the costs of compliance without recourse. Perhaps most problematic is the transformation of genuine participation into procedural formalities, where many participatory initiatives function as "box-ticking exercises" designed to satisfy legal or donor requirements, or to provide legitimacy for decisions that have already been made or have lost their relevance [(A.M. et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.17528/cifor/007593). This procedural capture allows elite interests to maintain control while providing the appearance of democratic participation, effectively co-opting the participatory process itself as a tool for maintaining existing power structures rather than redistributing influence more equitably.

## Spanish Agricultural Context and Farmer Marginalization

**Summary:** Spanish agriculture's participatory governance processes specifically marginalize family farmers, who often appear disorganized and weak with low self-esteem, requiring initial strengthening of local socio-economic networks before meaningful participation can occur. The structural power imbalances in Spanish agri-food systems create socio-ecological unsustainability that superficial participatory techniques cannot address. (5 sources)

The Spanish agricultural context reveals specific patterns of farmer marginalization that exemplify broader elite capture dynamics in participatory governance. Family farmers in Spain often appear disorganized and function as weak, marginalized actors, which manifests as low self-esteem both individually and collectively [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21683565.2025.2456946). This marginalization is so pronounced that in four out of five documented cases of agricultural transition, an initial task has been to strengthen the local socio-economic fabric of farmers before any meaningful participatory process could begin [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21683565.2025.2456946). The structural challenges in Spanish agriculture reflect broader power imbalances in agri-food systems that create socio-ecological unsustainability [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21683565.2025.2456946) [(Anderson et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su11195272). Participatory activities based on specific techniques and time-limited processes have been criticized for being superficial and unable to address these fundamental power imbalances [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21683565.2025.2456946) [(Mendez et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU9050705) [(Sachet et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2021.709401). This context requires formal governance structures to explicitly account for preexisting power imbalances and subaltern groups, designing governance processes specifically capable of addressing these inequalities [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21683565.2025.2456946). The empowerment of local actors becomes the main tool for making participatory processes truly transformative of the unbalanced power relations in the Spanish food system [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21683565.2025.2456946) [(Mendez et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU9050705) [(Anderson et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su11195272) [(Val et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21683565.2019.1600099) [(Sachet et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2021.709401), rather than simply providing procedural participation that maintains existing hierarchies.
