## Introduction: Mediterranean Agriculture and Climate Change Context

**Summary:** The Mediterranean region is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts on agriculture, facing increased drought, heat stress, and water scarcity that threaten traditional crops like olives, cereals, and vineyards. Climate change will intensify existing water management challenges while creating opportunities for improved agricultural practices and adaptation strategies. (7 sources)

The Mediterranean region has been identified as one of the most vulnerable areas to climate change, with agriculture being among the most exposed sectors due to its high dependence on climatic conditions and water resources [(Markou et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos11050483) [(Topp et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335083). The distinct Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild wet winters and warm dry summers, faces increasing challenges from escalating droughts and elevated temperatures that directly impact agricultural systems [(Matias et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/plants13141914). Climate change is expected to intensify existing risks, particularly in regions with current water scarcity, while also creating new opportunities for improving land and water management [(Iglesias et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.1007/S10113-010-0187-4). Water has always been the most critical resource for sustainable agricultural development in Mediterranean countries, where traditional crops like cereals, olive trees, and vineyards have adapted to drought stress and long dry seasonal periods [(Pozo et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11102769). However, future climate projections indicate increased crop evapotranspiration demand coupled with more unstable water supply due to decreased precipitation [(Pozo et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11102769). The impacts are expected to be severe and multifaceted. By 2050, the Mediterranean region may experience temperature increases of 0.8-2.3°C and rainfall decreases of up to 200mm per year, leading to displacement of crop distribution areas toward cooler, more humid zones [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10110509). Climate change impacts include reduced crop yields due to high temperatures, increased irrigation water demand, prolonged drought periods, and damage from extreme weather events [(Markou et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos11050483). Some Mediterranean regions may completely lose their suitability for cultivation of specific crops [(Topp et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335083) [(Ceglar et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019EF001178). These climate risks are amplified by existing challenges of generally poor soil quality, low soil organic matter, and soil degradation exacerbated by harsh climatic conditions and intensive agricultural practices [(Topp et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335083). Adaptation of Mediterranean agriculture to climate change requires integrated strategies encompassing different organizational levels: individual crops, cropping systems, and entire farming systems [(Pozo et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11102769). The response capacity depends on adaptive capacity indices that characterize economic capacity, human and civic resources, and agricultural innovation [(Iglesias et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.1007/S10113-010-0187-4).

## Soil Conservation and Management Strategies

**Summary:** Soil conservation and management strategies are central to Mediterranean agricultural adaptation, focusing on improving soil organic matter, water-holding capacity, and erosion control through conservation tillage, mulching, cover cropping, and water harvesting techniques. These practices enhance soil resilience to drought, temperature extremes, and precipitation variability while maintaining crop productivity. (7 sources)

Soil conservation and management form the foundation of climate adaptation strategies in Mediterranean agriculture, with management of soil organic matter being central to adapting to climate change due to its critical role in improving water holding capacity, increasing soil infiltration, buffering soil temperature, improving soil fertility, and enhancing soil microbial activities [(Agus et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.21082/jp3.v34n4.2015.p147-158). Various soil management techniques are available to reduce negative climate change effects, including conservation tillage, vegetative and engineering erosion control approaches, surface protection through mulching, water harvesting and redistribution, soil nutrient management, soil amelioration, and soil biological manipulation [(Agus et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.21082/jp3.v34n4.2015.p147-158). Conservation agriculture has emerged as a prominent land management strategy, relying on three core principles: minimum mechanical soil disturbance, permanent cover of crop residues remaining on fields after harvest, and species diversification through crop rotations [(Topp et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335083). Climate-smart agriculture practices focus particularly on improving soil water-holding capacity by adding crop residues or manure and adopting conservation tillage in response to changing water availability, with investments in soil-water holding capacity being especially important given the positive correlation between rainfall variability and the selection of such practices [(Mullins et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61194-5_16). Water management practices integrated with soil conservation offer some of the best strategies for climate adaptation, as they improve water balance, availability, infiltration and retention by soil while reducing water loss due to runoff and evaporation [(Teklewold et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2018.1442801). Soil conservation techniques such as grass strips, soil and stone bunds can improve household food security and reduce vulnerability by increasing soil water availability, decreasing soil erosion, and ensuring nutrients and inputs are maintained in plots [(Teklewold et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2018.1442801). Water harvesting technologies and innovative conservation measures that maximize soil water infiltration while minimizing evapotranspiration provide important sources of agricultural water to sustain production during dry spells and in drought-prone regions [(Nhemachena et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W12102673). For Mediterranean olive cultivation specifically, implementing vegetation covers serves as a climate change mitigation measure, contributing to greenhouse gas reduction, increasing organic matter and soil fertility, and improving rainwater infiltration while mitigating erosion processes [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10110509). Long-term practices such as cover cropping, mulching, and soil amendments including biochar, natural zeolites, and olive mill wastes show promise in enhancing soil health, improving water retention, and boosting plant resilience to climate stressors [(Martins et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae10101066). Sustainable conservation tillage options, including no-tillage or reduced tillage, help reduce off-farm inputs while building soil fertility and increasing soil organic carbon, which is a key factor for olive grove resilience and climate change adaptation [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10110509).

## Water Management and Conservation Techniques

**Summary:** Water management and conservation techniques are fundamental "best bet" strategies for Mediterranean agricultural adaptation, focusing on efficient irrigation technologies, water harvesting, soil water storage improvements, and integrated approaches that combine conservation tillage with crop management practices. These techniques help farmers maintain productivity while adapting to increased water scarcity and variable precipitation patterns. (7 sources)

Agricultural water management practices offer one of the "best bet" strategies for adapting agricultural production to climate change and variability because they improve water balance, availability, infiltration and retention by the soil; reduce water loss due to runoff and evaporation; and improve the quality and availability of ground and surface water [(Teklewold et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2018.1442801). Water management achieves stability of crop production by maintaining soil conditions close to optimum for crop growth, allowing water to seep into the soil through infiltration, improving soil vegetation cover, increasing groundwater recharge, and protecting topsoil [(Teklewold et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2018.1442801). Investment in soil water-holding capacity represents a particularly important adaptive response, with recent research finding a positive correlation between rainfall variability and the selection of practices that improve soil water-holding capacity through adding crop residues or manure and adopting conservation tillage in response to changes in water availability [(Mullins et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61194-5_16). Climate-smart agriculture encompasses multiple water management approaches including water harvesting, drip irrigation for water and nutrient management, and integrated planning that covers multipurpose water harvesting and climate resilience [(Kumari et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.20546/IJCMAS.2019.803.134). Specific water management technologies include inter-annual water harvesting techniques to store excess rainfall and flood control measures, resource-efficient irrigation technologies, land conservation techniques to improve residual soil moisture, and mulching and zero tillage techniques [(Nhemachena et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W12102673). Water harvesting technologies and soil water management provide important sources of agricultural water to improve and sustain production during dry spells and in drought-prone regions [(Nhemachena et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W12102673). Adaptation strategies should focus on opportunities to increase soil water availability through interventions that maximize soil water infiltration, minimize evapotranspiration, implement innovative water conservation measures, harvest surface runoff to provide supplemental water for irrigation, and expand irrigated areas using saved water through improved irrigation systems [(Nhemachena et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W12102673). Water management strategies crucial for climate adaptation include rainwater harvesting, efficient irrigation techniques such as drip irrigation, and mulch use to reduce water evaporation, alongside water conservation through reducing losses from leakage and evaporation [(Zenda et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/cli12030033). For Mediterranean olive cultivation specifically, achieving sustained productivity under extreme climate conditions requires implementing good agricultural practices including improved irrigation management coupled with sustainable soil-improvement methods to mitigate water and nutrient losses in the long term [(Hrameche et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/plants13060900). Promotion of water-efficient irrigation technologies such as drip irrigation and deficit irrigation strategies, combined with cultivation of cover crops and permanent ground cover practices, help capture and store excess rainfall for use during dry periods while extending season length through increased water access [(Nhamo et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE9020030).

## Crop Selection and Breeding Strategies

**Summary:** Crop selection and breeding strategies for Mediterranean climate adaptation focus on developing drought-tolerant, heat-resistant, and early-maturing varieties while incorporating neglected and underutilized species. These approaches include adjusting planting dates, diversifying crop portfolios, and breeding climate-resilient cultivars that maintain productivity under water stress and extreme temperatures. (10 sources)

• **Development of climate-resilient varieties**: The development of improved varieties such as early maturing, drought and heat tolerant cultivars is necessary to sustain productivity under changing climate conditions, with new cultivars designed to increase production per unit area under moisture stress and extreme temperatures [(Ahmed et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.5772/INTECHOPEN.82697) [(Temesgen, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.17352/2455-815X.000111). New research and development in crop varieties that are more resistant to drought, disease, and heat stress will increase the resilience of agronomic systems to climate change [(Jbawi, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3126/ije.v9i1.27653). • **Early-maturing cultivars for drought escape**: Innovation of early maturing cultivars has greater potential for escaping the effects of drought, which is increasingly important to address water scarcity limitations due to changing rainfall patterns [(Chhetri, 2012)](https://doi.org/10.5772/29757). Where seasons are becoming shorter, the promotion of early maturing varieties would be suitable for shifting seasons and season duration [(Nhamo et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE9020030). • **Crop diversification strategies**: Important adaptation options include crop diversification, mixed crop-livestock farming systems, using different crop varieties, and mixing less productive drought-resistant varieties with high-yield water sensitive crops [(Ngo, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.5897/ajar2015.10756). Crop diversification can serve as insurance against rainfall variability as different crops are affected differently by climate events [(Ngo, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.5897/ajar2015.10756). • **Neglected and underutilized species (NUS)**: Mediterranean agriculture may involve cultivation of more resilient crop species, including neglected and underutilized species and improved bred crop varieties, as promising alternatives for cultivation in diverse ecosystems where their adaptability can contribute to increased agricultural productivity [(Matias et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/plants13141914). This includes promotion of underutilized indigenous and traditional crops that have shown adaptation to low and variable rainfall environments [(Nhamo et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE9020030). • **Planting date adjustments**: Farmers have adapted to climate change variability through adjustment of planting time and optimization of plant populations, with adjusting planting time with the onset of rains and heat waves helping to decrease yield losses [(Ahmed et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.5772/INTECHOPEN.82697). Crop management practices include modifying the length of the growing period and changing planting and harvesting dates to ensure critical crop growth stages do not coincide with harsh climatic conditions [(Ngo, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.5897/ajar2015.10756). • **Genetic diversity preservation**: Adaptability essentially relies on the availability of genetic variability within and between crop species, with the largest genetic variation offering greater opportunities for improvement to adapt to environmental conditions [(Temesgen, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.17352/2455-815X.000111). The preservation of genetic resources of crops and their wild relatives is fundamental in developing resilience to shocks, improving efficient use of resources, and generating higher yields per area of land [(Mesfin, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.7176/jbah/9-12-02). • **Stress-adapted germplasm**: Climate-smart agriculture encompasses stress-adapted crop germplasm, including drought-tolerant maize varieties, as part of a broad array of agricultural technologies and practices [(Hellin et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s43170-023-00172-4). Planting drought-tolerant crop varieties is an effective adaptation strategy as these crops can withstand periods of low water availability and maintain productivity even with less rainfall [(Zenda et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/cli12030033).

## Mediterranean Olive Cultivation Adaptation

**Summary:** Mediterranean olive cultivation faces significant climate change challenges requiring both immediate management adjustments and long-term adaptation strategies. Climate projections indicate olive growing areas will shift to cooler, more humid zones while requiring new drought-resistant varieties, improved soil management, and integrated approaches combining irrigation, pruning, and soil conservation techniques. (3 sources)

Despite the olive tree's impressive adaptation to Mediterranean climate conditions, global climate change will introduce changes in agricultural ecosystems that will affect photosynthesis and plant productivity [(Hrameche et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/plants13060900). Climate projections reveal substantial challenges for olive cultivation, including altered precipitation patterns, rising temperatures, and increased frequency of extreme weather events that will impact olive tree growth, fruit quality, and overall yield [(Martins et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae10101066). Based on projections of temperature increases of 0.8-2.3°C and rainfall decreases of up to 200mm per year by 2050 in the Mediterranean, a displacement of olive grove distribution areas is expected towards zones of lower temperature and higher moisture [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10110509). These predicted climatic conditions would increase evapotranspiration of vegetation and reduce chill accumulation in olive groves, altering flowering, fructification and crop yields [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10110509). Addressing these challenges requires both expansion of olive cultivation into new areas and significant adjustments in management practices at the regional level [(Martins et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae10101066). It is necessary to adopt management models that promote olive grove resilience, including the introduction of new olive varieties more resistant to temperature increases and drought events to ensure their viability [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10110509). Long-term adaptation strategies include cover cropping, mulching, soil amendments such as biochar, natural zeolites, and olive mill wastes, and breeding programs that show promise in enhancing soil health, improving water retention, and boosting plants' resilience to climate stressors [(Martins et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae10101066). Sustainable conservation tillage options, including no-tillage or reduced tillage, help reduce off-farm inputs while building soil fertility, with increased soil organic carbon being a key factor for olive grove resilience and climate change adaptation [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10110509). Short-term strategies can provide immediate relief and improve plant physiological responses under adverse conditions, including optimized irrigation systems, pruning management, particle coating films such as kaolin and calcium-based products, and exogenous application of biostimulants and plant growth regulators [(Martins et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae10101066). Achieving sustained olive productivity in extreme climate conditions necessitates implementing Good Agricultural Practices including improved management of pruning, irrigation, and fertilization techniques, coupled with sustainable soil-improvement methods to mitigate water and nutrient losses in the long term [(Hrameche et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/plants13060900).

## Climate-Smart Agriculture Practices

**Summary:** Climate-smart agriculture provides integrated solutions for Mediterranean agricultural adaptation through practices like conservation tillage, intercropping, agroforestry, and precision farming that simultaneously enhance productivity, build climate resilience, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These practices focus on soil health improvement, water conservation, crop diversification, and stress-adapted varieties to create sustainable farming systems. (12 sources)

Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) encompasses a broad array of agricultural technologies and practices, including stress-adapted crop germplasm such as drought-tolerant maize varieties, conservation agriculture, agroforestry, and soil and water conservation [(Hellin et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s43170-023-00172-4). CSA is comprised of agricultural practices that help farmers adapt to specific climatic factors, especially temperature and rainfall, through sustainable agricultural operations like conservation tillage, agroforestry, residue management, crop shifting, intercropping, alley farming, multipurpose crops, water harvesting, and drip irrigation for water and nutrient management [(Kumari et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.20546/IJCMAS.2019.803.134). The adoption of CSA improves the resilience of farming systems by providing a balance while prioritizing adaptation, mitigation, and food security, jointly offering the benefits of increased productivity and enhanced climate change adaptation and mitigation [(Abegunde et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14042317). CSA involves implementing practices that enhance productivity, increase resilience to climate variability, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions through techniques such as conservation agriculture, agroforestry, and improved water management [(Chuma et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-72021-x). Specific CSA practices include intercropping of staple crops like maize with cash crops like legumes, as well as improvement of soil water-holding capacity by adding crop residues or manure and adopting conservation tillage in response to changes in water availability [(Mullins et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61194-5_16). Climate-smart agricultural practices such as crop diversification, conservation agriculture, and precision farming enhance resilience and mitigate the impacts of climate change on crop yields, while investments in climate-resilient crop varieties, improved water management techniques, and sustainable land management practices offer pathways for building adaptive capacities [(Naik et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.9734/acri/2024/v24i5743). Many climate-smart practices that address both adaptation and mitigation goals are already well-known and fall under the greater umbrella of conservation agriculture, agroforestry, sustainable agriculture, evergreen agriculture, silvo-pastoral systems, sustainable land management, eco-agriculture, or best-management practices [(Possu et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.15406/APAR.2018.08.00361). Climate-smart innovations, including minimum tillage, cereal-legume intercropping, and their combination, reduce the incidence and depth of poverty while adopting climate-smart practices positively impacts food and nutrition security [(Zheng et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2024.2385095). Implementation strategies focus on promoting water-efficient irrigation technologies such as drip irrigation and deficit irrigation, breeding drought-tolerant and water-efficient crops suitable for low and variable rainfall environments, and promoting underutilized indigenous and traditional crops that have shown adaptation to these environments [(Nhamo et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE9020030). Harnessing climate-smart technologies, including precision agriculture, drought-resistant crop varieties, and digital innovations, represents a key approach to mitigating climate risks while investing in soil health through regenerative techniques that enhance soil fertility and water retention [(Suri, 2025)](https://doi.org/10.11648/j.ijnfs.20251402.12). Policies supporting CSA adoption should focus on promoting adaptation strategies that are affordable and accessible to farmers, including improved access to weather information, drought-resistant crop varieties, and water management technologies [(Baraka, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.47604/ija.1971). Strategies for agricultural adaptation emphasize biodiversity-based or "ecologically intensive" agriculture and climate-smart agriculture as low-impact strategies with strong ecological modernization, aiming to sustainably increase agricultural productivity and incomes while addressing the interrelated challenges of climate change and food security [(Grigorieva et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/cli11100202).

## Implementation and Policy Considerations

**Summary:** Successful implementation of Mediterranean agricultural climate adaptation requires multi-level policy frameworks that support farmer access to climate-smart technologies, drought-resistant varieties, and water management systems. Effective policies must integrate climate adaptation into broader agricultural strategies while emphasizing affordable, accessible solutions and strengthening adaptive capacity through economic support, knowledge transfer, and agricultural innovation. (6 sources)

Implementation of climate adaptation strategies in Mediterranean agriculture requires coordinated approaches across multiple organizational levels, addressing individual crops, cropping systems, and entire farming systems. The adaptive capacity of Mediterranean agriculture depends on three major components: economic capacity, human and civic resources, and agricultural innovation [(Iglesias et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.1007/S10113-010-0187-4). This adaptive capacity represents the ability of agricultural systems to respond effectively to climate change risks and opportunities, particularly in regions facing intensified water scarcity. Policy frameworks must prioritize the most effective adaptation measures based on systematic evaluation criteria including efficiency, urgency of implementation, technical difficulty, economic viability, and social acceptance. Research indicates that twelve recommended adaptation measures achieve high effectiveness scores (≥60%), primarily focusing on irrigation adaptation measures, cultural practices, and methods for upgrading external services to farmers [(Markou et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos11050483). These measures address key climate impacts including drought stress, heat stress, decreasing plant health, extreme weather events, and reduced crop productivity. Effective policy implementation requires targeting different levels of intervention. At local and regional levels, strategies should emphasize crop varieties and management including land use change and innovative breeding techniques, water and soil management through improved agronomic practices, and farmer training and knowledge transfer. At regional and national levels, policies must establish financial schemes, insurance mechanisms, agricultural and meteorological services, and research and development programs including early warning systems [(Grigorieva et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/cli11100202). Adaptation strategies implemented by policymakers must encompass development of drought-resistant crop varieties, improved water management practices, and promotion of climate-smart agricultural techniques. Policy frameworks should emphasize integrating climate adaptation into broader agricultural policies while supporting adoption of sustainable agricultural practices [(Amruddin et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.59613/global.v2i1.50). This integration ensures that climate adaptation becomes embedded within existing agricultural development programs rather than operating as separate initiatives. Policies supporting farmer adoption should focus on promoting adaptation strategies that are affordable and accessible, including improved access to weather information, drought-resistant crop varieties, and water management technologies [(Baraka, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.47604/ija.1971). Mediterranean adaptation measures typically allocate resources across multiple strategic areas, with approximately 52% dedicated to ecosystem resilience, 31% to adaptive capacity, 9% to microclimate management, 7% to protection strategies, and less than 1% to mitigation approaches [(Vizinho et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND10020161). Successful implementation requires policies that promote biodiversity-based or "ecologically intensive" agriculture and climate-smart agriculture as low-impact strategies with strong ecological modernization potential. These approaches aim to sustainably increase agricultural productivity and incomes while simultaneously addressing the interrelated challenges of climate change and food security [(Grigorieva et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/cli11100202). Policy success depends on creating supportive institutional environments that facilitate technology transfer, provide economic incentives for adoption, and ensure that adaptation measures remain economically viable for farmers across different scales of operation.
