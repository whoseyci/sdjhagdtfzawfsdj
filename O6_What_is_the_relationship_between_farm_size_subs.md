## Introduction

**Summary:** Mediterranean olive farming shows complex relationships between farm size, subsidy dependency, and sustainable practice adoption, with small and large farms facing different challenges and opportunities. Understanding these interconnections is crucial for developing effective agricultural policies that promote both economic viability and environmental sustainability. (LLM Memory)

The relationship between farm size, subsidy dependency, and sustainable practice adoption in Mediterranean olive production represents a multifaceted challenge that shapes the future of this traditional agricultural sector. Mediterranean olive groves, which span across countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and parts of North Africa, operate within diverse economic and environmental contexts that influence how farmers make decisions about production methods and resource management . Farm size emerges as a key factor that affects both the economic structure of operations and the feasibility of implementing sustainable practices, while subsidy systems create additional layers of complexity in farmer decision-making processes . The adoption of sustainable practices in olive production is not simply determined by environmental awareness but is deeply intertwined with economic constraints, policy incentives, and the practical realities of different farm scales . These interconnected factors create distinct patterns of agricultural behavior that vary significantly across the Mediterranean region, influencing everything from soil management and water use efficiency to biodiversity conservation and long-term farm viability .

## Farm Size and Production Systems

**Summary:** Farm size significantly influences production systems in Mediterranean olive farming, with larger farms having better access to knowledge and technology while smaller traditional farms face economic pressures that drive them toward intensification or abandonment. The shift from traditional to intensive production systems has created new dependencies on external inputs and reduced reliance on local knowledge. (4 sources)

Farm size plays a crucial role in determining both the production systems adopted and the economic viability of Mediterranean olive operations. Larger farms typically demonstrate enhanced access to knowledge and technology, with studies showing that large area olive farming operations are linked with higher knowledge levels of integrated pest management practices [(Allahyari et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE7120101). This knowledge advantage stems from increased farming experience that comes with managing larger olive production areas, creating a feedback loop where scale enables better technical management [(Allahyari et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE7120101). The economic pressures facing different farm sizes have led to distinct trajectories in production system evolution. Traditional Mediterranean olive farmers, particularly those operating smaller, fragmented holdings, face escalating production costs that hamper farm competitiveness, while intensive farming has driven down overall market prices, making most traditional olive farms barely viable or entirely unviable [(Gomes et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12073059). These economic constraints have pushed traditional farmers toward two main paths: either abandoning traditional practices to adopt more profitable intensive (200-400 plants/ha) or super-intensive (600-2000 plants/ha) systems, or leaving agriculture entirely, which results in farmland abandonment [(Gomes et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12073059). The intensification process itself has created new production system dependencies that particularly affect smaller operations. The expansion and intensification of olive production, driven partly by subsidy changes and new technology availability, has led to the replacement of traditional pest-resistant but lower-yield cultivars with higher-yielding varieties that are more vulnerable to local pests and diseases, requiring increased pesticide use [(Salvia et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su11236762). This shift has resulted in increased dependence on imported materials such as agri-chemicals and machinery, while simultaneously reducing the availability and use of local knowledge and production skills, impacts that are particularly felt by small, mixed family farms [(Salvia et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su11236762). Meanwhile, access to direct payments has historically favored larger farms and other agricultural systems, with traditional Mediterranean farming systems, especially olive groves, facing obstacles in obtaining such support, though some redistribution from larger to smaller farmers has occurred between 2009 and 2019 [(Dinis, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40100-024-00299-6).

## Subsidy Dependency and Farm Characteristics

**Summary:** Subsidy dependency varies significantly across Mediterranean olive farms based on their characteristics, with organic farms showing higher dependency on CAP payments while more profitable conventional farms demonstrate less reliance on EU subsidies. The current subsidy system creates different incentives and constraints that influence both farm viability and sustainable practice adoption. (6 sources)

Subsidy dependency in Mediterranean olive production shows distinct patterns based on farm characteristics and production systems. More profitable conventional farms demonstrate lower dependency on EU subsidies, which provides them greater flexibility in management decisions, as evidenced by their higher likelihood to maintain traditional practices like stonewalls since they can bear the maintenance costs without relying on external support [(Leyva et al., 2007)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2007053-246). However, despite the availability of EU incentives for sustainable practices through agro-environmental schemes, only 7% of farmers in studies mention subsidies as an important factor influencing their agricultural decisions, suggesting that subsidy programs may not be effectively designed or communicated to drive sustainable practice adoption [(Aznar-Sanchez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10040506). Organic olive farms exhibit a markedly different subsidy dependency profile, showing 9% higher dependence on CAP subsidies compared to conventional operations [(Martin-Garcia et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40100-023-00292-5). This higher dependency stems primarily from subsidies under the second pillar of the CAP, which have been crucial in promoting organic farming adoption, particularly in less productive areas such as mountainous regions where conventional yields are low [(Martin-Garcia et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40100-023-00292-5). The subsidy system has effectively compensated for productivity losses during organic conversion in areas with yields below 2000 kg of olives per hectare, explaining why organic adoption has been concentrated in traditionally less productive regions [(Martin-Garcia et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40100-023-00292-5). The current subsidy framework creates problematic dependencies that can undermine farm competitiveness and sustainability goals. Many conventional producers have shifted their focus away from production profitability, instead relying on CAP subsidies to maintain business viability, which has contributed to the intensification model's dominance and associated social and ecological consequences including rural depopulation and increased water demands [(Sapena et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.58567/jie01040004). Historical subsidy structures continue to influence current farm efficiency, with the legacy effects of pre-2000 production-coupled payments still affecting farms with larger acreages, suggesting that better utilization of current subsidies is needed to improve overall farm efficiency [(Niavis et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE8020025). Traditional Mediterranean farming systems, particularly olive groves, have historically faced obstacles in accessing direct payments compared to cereals and cattle operations, though some redistribution occurred between 2009 and 2019 from larger to smaller farmers [(Dinis, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40100-024-00299-6).

## Sustainable Practice Adoption Patterns

**Summary:** Sustainable practice adoption in Mediterranean olive farming is primarily driven by policy changes and subsidy incentives rather than production profitability, with organic farming expansion concentrated in less productive areas where conversion costs are lower. Farm characteristics like subsidy dependency, farming commitment, and environmental awareness significantly influence eco-efficiency outcomes. (4 sources)

The adoption of sustainable practices in Mediterranean olive production has been fundamentally shaped by policy shifts rather than market-driven incentives. The expansion of organic olive groves is mainly due to changes in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which has moved away from subsidies directly proportional to production toward encouraging agricultural practices aimed at maximizing crop sustainability and rural development on a regional scale [(Sousa et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13147983). This policy transformation has placed value on the non-productive ecosystem services of olive groves, with the organic model being promoted as an environmentally friendly management approach that can respond to farmers' demands for economic stability while meeting social demands for quality products based on food security [(Sousa et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13147983). The geographic and economic patterns of organic adoption reveal strategic responses to productivity constraints and subsidy availability. CAP support through second pillar subsidies has been a key factor in promoting organic farming adoption, especially in olive groves with low productivity levels under conventional systems, such as those in mountainous areas [(Martin-Garcia et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40100-023-00292-5). With relatively small amounts of agri-environmental subsidies, it has been possible to compensate for productivity drops resulting from organic conversion, explaining why organic olive farming has already been adopted in most Spanish areas where olive groves are relatively less productive, with average annual yields lower than 2000 kg of olives per hectare [(Martin-Garcia et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40100-023-00292-5). Farm-level characteristics significantly influence sustainable practice effectiveness and adoption patterns. Research indicates that organic farms achieve the highest eco-efficiency scores, followed by other ecological approaches, with eco-efficiency being explained by farmers' dependency on subsidies, commitment to farming activity, and environmental awareness [(Sintori et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13010072). However, structural barriers continue to limit sustainable practice implementation, as issues such as land tenure security, limited access to finance, and inadequate government subsidies can hinder farmers' ability to implement recommended sustainability strategies [(Martins et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae10101066).

## Interactions Between Farm Size, Subsidies, and Sustainability

**Summary:** The interactions between farm size, subsidies, and sustainability create complex patterns where larger, more profitable farms can afford sustainable practices without subsidy dependence, while smaller farms rely heavily on CAP support but face structural barriers to adoption. Current subsidy systems often disconnect profitability from production, leading to unintended consequences that may undermine both economic viability and environmental goals. (5 sources)

The complex interactions between farm size, subsidy dependency, and sustainable practice adoption reveal how these factors reinforce each other in ways that can either support or undermine sustainability goals. More profitable farms, which are typically larger operations with better economies of scale, demonstrate less dependence on EU subsidies and are therefore more likely to invest in sustainable practices like maintaining traditional stonewalls, as they can bear the maintenance costs without relying on external support [(Leyva et al., 2007)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2007053-246). This creates a paradox where farms that are economically viable enough to adopt sustainable practices are least dependent on the subsidy programs designed to incentive such adoption. The disconnect between subsidy availability and actual adoption decisions highlights structural problems in current policy design. Despite the European Union providing incentives for sustainable practices through agro-environmental schemes, only 7% of farmers mention subsidies as an important factor in their agricultural decisions, suggesting that farm characteristics such as small size or difficult terrain may create barriers that subsidies alone cannot overcome [(Aznar-Sanchez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10040506). This low influence of subsidies on decision-making occurs even though organic farms show 9% higher dependence on CAP subsidies, indicating that while subsidies enable organic adoption, they may not be effectively structured to drive broader sustainable practice implementation [(Martin-Garcia et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40100-023-00292-5). The relationship between subsidy dependency and sustainability outcomes shows that higher dependency does not necessarily compromise environmental performance. Research demonstrates that organic farms achieve the highest eco-efficiency scores despite their greater subsidy dependence, with eco-efficiency being explained by farmers' dependency on subsidies, commitment to farming activity, and environmental awareness [(Sintori et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13010072). However, the current subsidy system creates problematic dependencies where many conventional producers treat production profitability as secondary, relying on CAP subsidies to maintain business viability, which perpetuates the shift toward intensive production models with negative social and ecological consequences including rural depopulation and increased water demands [(Sapena et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.58567/jie01040004). These interactions suggest that effective policy interventions must account for the varying needs and capabilities of different farm sizes while restructuring incentives to reconnect sustainability with economic viability. The current system's tendency to support less productive areas through higher organic subsidies, while failing to incentivize sustainable practices on more productive conventional farms, creates a bifurcated agricultural landscape that may limit the overall environmental benefits achievable across the Mediterranean olive sector [(Martin-Garcia et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40100-023-00292-5).
