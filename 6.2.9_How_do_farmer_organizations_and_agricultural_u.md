**Research Query:** 6.2.9 How do farmer organizations and agricultural unions influence agricultural policy design and implementation in Spain?

---

## Introduction and Background

**Summary:** Spain uses a mixed public-private agricultural policy system where farmer organizations and unions play important roles alongside government bodies. This collaborative approach gives farmer groups significant influence in both designing and implementing agricultural policies. (1 source)

Spain's agricultural policy framework operates through a distinctive institutional arrangement that combines public governance with significant private sector participation. The Spanish system is based on a mixed public-private model, in which farmers' unions and association do also play a crucial role [(Garrido et al., 2007)](https://doi.org/10.1108/00214660880001218). This structural approach distinguishes Spain from purely state-directed agricultural policy systems and creates multiple pathways for farmer organizations to shape policy outcomes. The integration of farmer unions and agricultural associations into the policy process reflects Spain's recognition that effective agricultural governance requires the active participation of those who directly implement farming practices and understand local agricultural conditions .

## Policy Influence Mechanisms

**Summary:** Spanish farmer organizations use multiple channels to influence policy including direct advocacy to government and EU institutions, collective bargaining through tripartite processes, public campaigns targeting consumers and supermarkets, and knowledge dissemination on sustainable practices. (4 sources)

Spanish farmer organizations and agricultural unions employ diverse mechanisms to shape agricultural policy at both national and European levels. Direct advocacy represents a primary channel, with organizations like COAG engaging in political advocacy work with the Spanish Government and lobbying for favorable terms in the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), particularly focusing on calls for fairer prices and defense of professional family farming [(Gallar-Hernandez, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13074061). These unions amplify farmers' voices and lobby against unfavorable policies while working to generate shared visions among their members [(Manuel et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2023.2210500). The influence extends through formal institutional channels, particularly Spain's tripartite collective bargaining system. Trade unions work alongside local government and employers' associations in this process, which crucially determines workers' wages, working hours, and other working conditions at the local level by sector and region [(Medland, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21683565.2016.1224213). This institutional arrangement gives unions direct input into labor-related agricultural policies and regulations. Beyond formal channels, farmer organizations employ public-facing strategies to influence policy indirectly. These include staging demonstrations directed at supermarkets, promoting short-chain agriculture initiatives, and working with international journalists to draw attention to agricultural issues [(Medland, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21683565.2016.1224213). Additionally, agricultural cooperatives and farmer unions serve as knowledge disseminators, promoting sustainable agricultural practices to producers and acting as opinion leaders to convince farmers to adopt environmentally friendly production methods [(Mattas et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advnut.2023.03.011). However, some farmers express skepticism about union effectiveness, with concerns that "costs keep rising and nobody does anything" despite union advocacy efforts [(Manuel et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2023.2210500).

## Case Studies and Examples

**Summary:** Specific examples show Spanish farmer organizations successfully influencing policy through local advocacy, with the Basque Country unions creating agroecological networks that convinced municipalities to support sustainable transitions, and regional unions like in Ávila directly shaping agro-food quality policies. (3 sources)

Several concrete examples demonstrate how Spanish farmer organizations translate their advocacy mechanisms into real policy outcomes. In the Basque Country, farmer unions have successfully created comprehensive policy change through coordinated action. The "Etxalde" organization, working alongside the Emaús Foundation and academic institutions, established economic structures and networks with an agroecological approach, including initiatives like EH Kolektiboa while strengthening existing organic production networks such as Biolur and Ekonekazaritza. This coordinated advocacy achieved municipal-level policy adoption, with numerous municipalities including Zeberio, Orduña, and Larrabetxu becoming actively involved in promoting local agroecological transitions [(Espluga-Trenc et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13116068). Regional farmer unions have also demonstrated direct influence on specific policy domains. The Unión de Campesinos de Ávila (Ávila Peasant Farmers Union) provides a documented case study of farmer organization influence on agro-food quality policy during the period 1977-1990, showing how local unions can shape specialized policy areas through sustained engagement [(Pena-Ramos et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.2174/1874331501812010122). This pattern of local union influence mirrors successful cases elsewhere in Mediterranean Europe, where wine producer unions have effectively defended agricultural territories against competing land uses [(Perrin et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land9070223). These examples illustrate that Spanish farmer organizations achieve policy influence through both broad coalition-building approaches, as seen in the Basque Country's multi-organizational networks, and focused sector-specific advocacy, as demonstrated by regional unions targeting particular policy domains.

## Challenges and Limitations

**Summary:** Spanish farmer organizations face significant challenges in demonstrating concrete policy impact, with some farmers expressing disillusionment about union effectiveness. Research gaps also exist in systematically measuring how much influence these organizations actually have on policy outcomes. (2 sources)

Despite the various mechanisms and documented cases of farmer organization influence, Spanish agricultural unions and farmer groups face substantial limitations in their policy impact. A fundamental challenge lies in demonstrating tangible results to their membership base. Some farmers express growing disenchantment with union effectiveness, with sentiments that "costs keep rising and nobody does anything" despite ongoing advocacy efforts [(Manuel et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2023.2210500). This disconnect between organizational activity and perceived member benefits suggests that farmer organizations may struggle to translate their policy engagement into concrete economic improvements for their constituents. Beyond membership satisfaction, a broader challenge exists in the research and policy evaluation sphere. The influence that farmer organizations actually exert on public policy processes remains inadequately addressed in academic studies [(Pena-Ramos et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.2174/1874331501812010122). This knowledge gap makes it difficult to assess the true effectiveness of different advocacy strategies or to identify which approaches yield the most substantial policy changes. Without systematic evaluation of organizational influence, both farmer groups and policymakers operate with limited understanding of which collaborative mechanisms produce the best outcomes for Spanish agriculture. These limitations suggest that while Spanish farmer organizations have established institutional channels and advocacy mechanisms, translating this access into measurable policy benefits remains an ongoing challenge that affects both organizational credibility and evidence-based policy design.
