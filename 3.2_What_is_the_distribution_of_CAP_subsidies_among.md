**Research Query:** 3.2 What is the distribution of CAP subsidies among different farm sizes in Andalusian olive production, and how does this affect small versus large producers?

---

## Background

**Summary:** The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) provides subsidies to European farmers including those in Andalusia's olive sector, but these payments are distributed unequally based on farm size and historical production levels. This unequal distribution creates different economic impacts for small family farms versus large commercial operations. (LLM Memory)

The Common Agricultural Policy represents the European Union's main framework for supporting agricultural production and rural development across member states. In Andalusia, which contains the world's largest concentration of olive groves, CAP subsidies form a critical component of farm income for producers of all sizes . The subsidy system has evolved from production-based payments to area-based payments, but continues to favor larger operations due to economies of scale and historical payment allocations . Andalusian olive farms range from small family operations of just a few hectares to large commercial estates covering hundreds of hectares, creating significant variation in how CAP benefits are distributed across the sector . Understanding this distribution is essential for evaluating the policy's effectiveness in supporting rural livelihoods and maintaining the economic viability of different farm types in one of Europe's most important agricultural regions .

## Distribution of CAP Subsidies by Farm Size

**Summary:** CAP subsidies in Andalusian olive production are distributed unequally, with the vast majority of farms being very small (averaging 1.24 hectares per plot with over 70% smaller than 5 hectares) but still heavily dependent on subsidies. The current system based on historical payments and per-hectare allocations creates tensions between small and large producers who view the subsidy distribution differently. (2 sources)

The distribution of CAP subsidies among Andalusian olive farms reflects the highly fragmented nature of the sector's ownership structure. In Jaén province, which represents a significant portion of Andalusian olive production, approximately 86,400 olive farmers applied for CAP subsidies in 2019, with the total cultivated area divided among more than 440,000 plots resulting in an average size of around 1.24 hectares per plot [(Koch, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01236-6). This fragmentation means that more than 70% of olive plots are smaller than 5 hectares, indicating that the majority of subsidy recipients are small-scale producers [(Koch, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01236-6). The current CAP payment system provides decoupled payments per hectare based on historical references, with Spanish olive growers receiving significantly higher payments (€475.44 per hectare) compared to the average Spanish farmer (€266.84 per hectare) [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.30682/nm2303a). However, this distribution creates different perspectives among producers of varying sizes. Small producers depend heavily on these subsidies for their economic survival, while large landowners express skepticism about subsidies that they believe keep inefficient production methods alive [(Koch, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01236-6). Conversely, smallholder farmers often argue that the CAP disproportionally favors large landowners due to the per-hectare payment structure [(Koch, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01236-6). Future CAP reforms are designed to address some of these distributional concerns through targeted reductions and redistributive payments. Proposed changes include implementing cuts to CAP support that would primarily affect larger farms while protecting payments for the first 10 hectares, which would benefit smaller producers [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.30682/nm2303a). This approach aims to minimize the impact of any support reductions on the income distribution of olive farms while potentially creating a more equitable subsidy distribution [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.30682/nm2303a).

## Impact on Small Producers

**Summary:** Small olive producers in Andalusia face significant challenges from CAP subsidy dependence, as their fragmented farm structure prevents efficiency investments while making them vulnerable to production abandonment, particularly in marginal areas where costs exceed revenues. (2 sources)

CAP subsidies create a complex dependency relationship for small olive producers in Andalusia that simultaneously supports their survival while hindering long-term competitiveness. The fragmented ownership structure, where most producers own very small areas and depend heavily on subsidies for economic viability, actually inhibits large-scale investments in efficiency improvements that could make these farms more sustainable [(Koch, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01236-6). This creates a paradox where the support system designed to help small farmers may inadvertently trap them in inefficient production methods. Small producers face particular vulnerability to production abandonment, especially those operating in marginal areas with higher production costs and lower yields [(Santilli et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2011.6.S1.E15). The shift from production-coupled to decoupled aid under CAP reforms poses additional risks, as it may lead to production abandonment in systems where sale revenues do not cover production costs, with smaller farms in mountainous zones being especially at risk [(Santilli et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2011.6.S1.E15). Over the longer term, this could result in further concentration of olive production in areas with comparative advantages, such as plains that enable mechanization and irrigation, potentially displacing small producers from less favorable locations [(Santilli et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2011.6.S1.E15).

## Impact on Large Producers

**Summary:** Large olive producers in Andalusia benefit from the current CAP subsidy system through higher absolute payments due to their larger landholdings, but they express skepticism about subsidies that they believe maintain inefficient small-scale production. Future CAP reforms targeting payment reductions based on farm size may disproportionately affect these larger operations. (2 sources)

Large olive producers in Andalusia occupy a fundamentally different position within the CAP subsidy framework compared to their smaller counterparts. While the current decoupled payment system provides €475.44 per hectare to Spanish olive growers, significantly above the national average of €266.84 per hectare, large landowners benefit from substantially higher absolute subsidy amounts due to their extensive holdings [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.30682/nm2303a). However, these large producers maintain a critical perspective on the subsidy system, expressing skepticism about payments that they believe keep inefficient production methods alive among smaller farms [(Koch, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01236-6). The upcoming CAP reforms pose particular challenges for large producers, as the required convergence in decoupled payments will lead to reductions in payment entitlements that exceed the national average, directly affecting olive growers who currently receive above-average payments [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.30682/nm2303a). Additionally, the introduction of redistributive payments and targeted cuts based on farm size means that larger operations will bear the primary burden of any support reductions, while smaller farms receive protection through mechanisms like exempting the first 10 hectares from cuts [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.30682/nm2303a). This shift represents a deliberate policy move to address the historical advantage that large landowners have enjoyed under the per-hectare payment structure, potentially reducing their competitive advantage in the sector.

## Future CAP Reform Implications

**Summary:** Future CAP reforms will restructure subsidy distribution to favor smaller farms through redistributive payments and targeted cuts that primarily affect larger operations, while the shift to decoupled payments may accelerate production abandonment in marginal areas where small farms cannot cover production costs. (2 sources)

The upcoming CAP reforms represent a fundamental shift in how subsidies will be distributed among Andalusian olive producers, with changes specifically designed to address the current inequalities between small and large farms. The required convergence in decoupled payments will reduce payment entitlements that exceed the national average, directly affecting olive growers who currently receive €475.44 per hectare compared to the national average of €266.84 per hectare [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.30682/nm2303a). The introduction of redistributive payments targeting the first hectares of each farm means that reductions in CAP support will be implemented primarily after the first 10 hectares, protecting smaller producers while concentrating cuts on larger operations [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.30682/nm2303a). These reforms are specifically designed to minimize the impact of support reductions on farm income distribution, with evidence suggesting that a 50% reduction in CAP payments combined with protection for the first 10 hectares would produce similar distributional effects to smaller cuts, indicating that the new payment structure can effectively shield smaller producers from subsidy reductions [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.30682/nm2303a). However, the shift toward decoupled payments may create new challenges for the most vulnerable producers, as this change is predicted to lead to production abandonment in systems where sale revenues do not cover production costs, particularly affecting smaller farms in marginal mountain areas with higher production costs and lower yields [(Santilli et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2011.6.S1.E15). Over the longer term, these reforms may accelerate the concentration of olive production in areas with comparative advantages such as plains suitable for mechanization and irrigation, potentially displacing small producers from less favorable locations [(Santilli et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2011.6.S1.E15). This suggests that while CAP reforms aim to create more equitable subsidy distribution, they may simultaneously contribute to structural changes that could reduce the overall number of small producers in Andalusian olive farming.
