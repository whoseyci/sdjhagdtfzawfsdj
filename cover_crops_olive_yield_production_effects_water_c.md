## Introduction and Background

**Summary:** Cover crops are increasingly used in olive groves as an alternative to traditional tillage practices, offering soil protection benefits while potentially competing with olive trees for water and nutrients. The Mediterranean climate's hot, dry summers and variable rainfall patterns create unique challenges for implementing cover crop systems in olive production. (2 sources)

Cover crops are increasingly employed by farmers in olive groves as an alternative to traditional soil management practices [(Rodriguez-Lizana et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10071041). The introduction of spontaneous or cultivated cover crops along the inter-rows of olive trees has proven to be an efficient tool to reduce erosion, runoff and soil fertility loss, while also providing beneficial effects on soil properties [(Rodriguez-Lizana et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10071041) [(Busso et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.30550/j.lil/2022.59.2/2022.08.23). Gramineous species were initially recommended to farmers because of their good ground protection, relatively low competition with olive trees and easy use and control [(Rodriguez-Lizana et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10071041). The Mediterranean climate presents unique challenges for cover crop implementation, characterized by very hot and dry summers and a gap in precipitation during this season, with high inter-annual and intra-annual variability in rainfall including droughts and intense rainfall events [(Rodriguez-Lizana et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10071041). While olive trees are well adapted to these conditions and are not particularly demanding in terms of water and nutrients, traditional management involves leaving unprotected alleys between trees to allow roots to capture water and nutrients from the soil [(Rodriguez-Lizana et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10071041). Since olive trees are mostly rainfed, farmers typically control weeds through tillage to prevent competition for nutrients with other plants [(Rodriguez-Lizana et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10071041).

## Main Effects of Cover Crops on Olive Yields

**Summary:** Research shows mixed effects of cover crops on olive yields, with outcomes depending on cover crop type, timing, and management practices. Early-maturing legume cover crops generally show positive or neutral effects on yields, while some permanent cover crops may reduce production through competition for resources. (9 sources)

The effects of cover crops on olive yields vary considerably depending on the specific management approach and environmental conditions. Several studies have documented yield reductions when cover crops compete directly with olive trees for resources. In rainfed conditions, there is a high risk of competition for water between herbaceous vegetation and trees, which makes difficult the widespread use of cover crops, and the problem is typically the reduction in fruit yield, which usually occurs when the ground is managed with cover crops [(Raimundo et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.33552/WJASS.2019.01.000511) [(Ferreira et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2013112-3501) [(Rodrigues et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2015132-6252). This competitive effect was clearly demonstrated in a long-term Portuguese study where accumulated olive yields between 2002 and 2011 were significantly different across management systems: 187.2 kg per tree for herbicide treatment, 142.9 kg per tree for tillage, and only 89.5 kg per tree for sheep-walk treatment with vegetation cover [(Ferreira et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2013112-3501). However, strategic selection of cover crop species and timing can overcome these yield penalties. Cover cropping with early-maturing self-reseeding annual legumes in rainfed managed olive orchards may fulfill soil protection objectives while maintaining olive yield [(Raimundo et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.33552/WJASS.2019.01.000511) [(Rodrigues et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2015132-6252). These early-maturing cultivars compete less for water since their growing cycle finishes earlier in spring, and they can even increase plant nitrogen nutritional status and olive yield compared to natural vegetation treatments [(Raimundo et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.33552/WJASS.2019.01.000511). Recent studies have shown positive yield responses to well-managed cover crop systems. Leguminous cover crops and zeolites increased cumulative yields by 31.6% and 35.5% respectively compared to conventional tillage in Portuguese olive orchards [(Martins et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28062545). Similarly, other research found that olive yield increased from conventional tillage systems to the use of early maturing and self-reseeding cover crops, with positive effects attributed to the asynchronous biological cycle of cover crops relative to olive trees [(Martins et al._1, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13112674). The key advantage is that legumes nearly complete their life cycle just as olive trees' biological activity resumes, minimizing competition while providing soil benefits. Some studies report no significant effects on yields, suggesting that proper management can maintain productivity. No effect of soil management was found on olive or oil yield across three cropping seasons in Spanish trials, with fruit and oil yields affected by year but not by cover crop treatment [(Sastre et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/4974609). However, the type of cover crop matters significantly - one study found that while Medicago treatment resulted in numerically higher fruit yields (12-21% higher), this occurred only where cover crop establishment was very poor, suggesting that well-established vetch-based cover crops may compete more strongly with olive trees [(Volakakis et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12102523). The response also depends on tree age and density. Trees under conventional tillage grew and yielded more than those under natural cover during the period of increasing yields (years 4-7) but not when they reached full production [(Simoni et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11061036). Some permanent cover crop systems have shown remarkable long-term benefits, with trees managed under sustainable models producing almost constantly every year with average yields of 8.4 Mg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹, while traditionally tilled plants showed lower production (3.1 Mg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹) and strong yield alternation [(Santilli et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2011.6.S1.E15).

## Water Competition Between Cover Crops and Olive Trees

**Summary:** Water competition is the primary limiting factor for cover crop adoption in rainfed olive systems, with competition intensity depending on timing, species selection, and management practices. Early-maturing legume cover crops that complete their lifecycle before olive trees become active can minimize water competition while providing soil benefits. (8 sources)

Water competition represents the most significant challenge in implementing cover crop systems in Mediterranean olive groves. In rainfed conditions, there is a high risk of competition for water between herbaceous vegetation and trees, which makes difficult the widespread use of cover crops, with the problem typically being the reduction in fruit yield [(Raimundo et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.33552/WJASS.2019.01.000511) [(Ferreira et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2013112-3501). This competition can be particularly severe during dry years, as demonstrated in vineyard studies where cover crops caused yield reductions during periods of scarce summer rainfall due to intensified water competition [(Gattullo et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10091334). The timing of cover crop growth relative to olive tree activity is crucial for managing water competition. Early-maturing cultivars compete less for water since their growing cycle finishes earlier in spring, and they transpire less water during the growing season, particularly late in spring when soil available water is particularly scarce [(Rodrigues et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2015132-6252). The most promising approach involves cover crop species with an asynchronous biological cycle relative to olive trees, since the legumes have almost concluded their cycle when the biological activity of olive trees returns [(Martins et al._1, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13112674). Regional climate differences significantly affect the optimal timing for cover crop termination to avoid water stress. Cover crops' lifetime could be prolonged in Peloponnese up to April in years with sufficient spring rainfall, while in Crete, cover crops should be terminated by the end of March at the latest to avoid water competition with olive trees [(Chatzistathis et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE11080692). Management practices such as mowing can also reduce competition, with studies showing that early-date killing of cover crops in mid-March can attenuate negative impacts on olive transpiration [(Rodriguez et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems6040087). Despite short-term competitive effects, strategic cover crop management can actually improve water availability over time. While herbaceous vegetation may outcompete olive trees for resources when they are available in short pulses, mowing the herbaceous cover crops in spring and leaving residues as mulch can reduce potential negative effects of water competition [(Maranon-Jimenez et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2022.126597). Additionally, cover crops with significant biomass can improve soil water-holding capacity and reduce evaporation through mulch residues, contributing to increased water availability during critical summer drought periods [(Martins et al._1, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13112674).

## Temporal Patterns and Timing Considerations

**Summary:** The timing of cover crop growth cycles relative to olive tree activity is critical for success, with early-maturing legumes that complete their lifecycle by mid-spring showing the best results. Regional climate variations require different termination dates, with cover crops needing earlier termination in drier Mediterranean areas to prevent water competition. (6 sources)

The most successful cover crop systems rely on selecting species with asynchronous biological cycles relative to olive trees. Early-maturing cultivars compete less for water since their growing cycle finishes earlier in spring, and they transpire less water during the growing season, particularly late in spring when soil available water is particularly scarce [(Rodrigues et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2015132-6252). The ideal timing involves legumes that have almost concluded their cycle when the biological activity of olive trees returns, creating minimal overlap in resource demands [(Martins et al._1, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13112674). Regional climate differences significantly influence optimal cover crop management timing. Cover crops' lifetime could be prolonged in Peloponnese up to April in years with sufficient spring rainfall, while in Crete, cover crops should be terminated by the end of March at the latest to avoid water competition with olive trees [(Chatzistathis et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE11080692). This variation reflects the different precipitation patterns and water availability across Mediterranean regions. Strategic mowing practices can extend the beneficial period of cover crops while preventing competition. Cover crops should be mowed in mid-May to prevent competition for soil water with olive trees, with adventitious vegetation chemically controlled along tree rows during late winter-early spring [(Arias-Giraldo et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11071387). Mowing herbaceous cover crops in spring and leaving residues as mulch can reduce potential negative effects of water competition [(Maranon-Jimenez et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2022.126597). The key to successful cover crop implementation lies in recognizing that while herbaceous vegetation may outcompete olive trees for resources in short pulses after precipitation or fertilization events, proper timing management can minimize these negative interactions [(Maranon-Jimenez et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2022.126597). Early-maturing self-reseeding annual legumes represent the optimal solution, as their growing cycles finish early in spring, greatly reducing competition for water while still providing soil protection and nitrogen fixation benefits [(Raimundo et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.33552/WJASS.2019.01.000511).

## Management Strategies and Cover Crop Selection

**Summary:** Successful cover crop management in olive groves requires selecting self-reseeding, early-maturing annual legumes that minimize water competition while providing soil benefits. Strategic mowing, proper termination timing, and species selection based on nitrogen fixation capacity are key factors for maintaining or increasing olive yields. (6 sources)

The ideal cover crop species for olive orchards should possess three key characteristics: self-reseeding capability to maximize soil protection and reduce costs, early maturation to minimize water competition, and leguminous nature to improve soil fertility and biological activity [(Martins et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae10101066) [(Raimundo et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.33552/WJASS.2019.01.000511). These early-maturing self-reseeding annual legumes have proven most effective at protecting soil from erosion, sequestering carbon, increasing soil organic matter, and fixing nitrogen while promoting tree nutritional status and fruit yield [(Raimundo et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.33552/WJASS.2019.01.000511) [(Rodrigues et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2015132-6252). Species selection must balance nitrogen fixation potential with competitive effects. While early-maturing cultivars produce less biomass and fix less nitrogen (approximately 50 kg N/ha/year) compared to late-maturing varieties, they compete less for water since their growing cycle finishes earlier in spring [(Rodrigues et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2015132-6252). However, excessive nitrogen competition can negatively impact yields, as demonstrated with certain grass species that significantly reduced olive yield despite improving soil organic carbon [(Sastre et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12082230). Legume cover crops like certain cultivars represent the optimal balance, improving soil organic carbon stocks and aggregate stability while maintaining similar yields to conventional tillage [(Sastre et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12082230). Strategic mowing practices are essential for preventing competition while maximizing benefits. Cover crops should be mowed in mid-May to prevent competition for soil water with olive trees, while adventitious vegetation along tree rows should be chemically controlled during late winter-early spring . Mowing herbaceous cover crops in spring and leaving residues as mulch can reduce potential negative effects of water competition . Cover crop biomass can serve dual purposes beyond soil improvement. The biomass can be cut and used as animal feed, increasing the olive ecosystem's profitability while leaving residues to serve as bio-fertilizers [(Elhaddad et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su16135329). All cover crop types, including spontaneous vegetation, significantly increase soil organic matter and macronutrient levels, particularly available phosphorus, with legumes like fenugreek showing the highest soil nitrogen levels [(Elhaddad et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su16135329). The most successful management approach recognizes that while herbaceous vegetation may temporarily outcompete olive trees for resources during precipitation or fertilization events, the long-term benefits of improved nutrient retention, enhanced soil microbial activity, increased carbon sequestration, and reduced erosion justify their use, particularly in degraded areas or steep slopes where cover maintenance alone may increase olive yield [(Sastre et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/4974609).

## Mediterranean Climate Considerations and Regional Variations

**Summary:** Mediterranean climate characteristics create region-specific requirements for cover crop management, with timing of termination varying significantly between locations based on local rainfall patterns. Northern Mediterranean regions can maintain cover crops longer into spring, while drier southern areas require earlier termination to prevent water competition. (6 sources)

The Mediterranean climate's distinctive characteristics of very hot and dry summers with high inter-annual and intra-annual rainfall variability, including droughts and intense rainfall events, create unique challenges for cover crop implementation [(Rodriguez-Lizana et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10071041). While olive trees are well adapted to these conditions and are not particularly demanding in terms of water and nutrients, traditional management involves leaving unprotected alleys between trees to allow roots to capture water and nutrients from the soil [(Rodriguez-Lizana et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10071041). Regional variations within the Mediterranean basin require different management approaches for optimal cover crop success. Cover crops' lifetime could be prolonged in Peloponnese up to April in years with sufficient spring rainfall, while in Crete, cover crops should be terminated by the end of March at the latest to avoid water competition with olive trees [(Chatzistathis et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE11080692). This variation reflects the different precipitation patterns and water availability across Mediterranean regions, with northern areas generally receiving more spring rainfall than southern locations. The weather-specific nature of cover crop benefits becomes particularly important under Mediterranean conditions. Cover crop benefits are more weather-specific than site-specific because when precipitation is low or not properly distributed, the water reduction after cover crops could have a negative effect on the cash crop growth and yield [(Rodriguez et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems6040087) [(Arampatzis et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.2166/WCC.2018.224). Research examining rainfed olive orchards determined that the use of cover crops in a Mediterranean environment has a negative impact on olive transpiration with an average 25% reduction, although this impact can be attenuated by early-date killing of the cover crop in mid-March [(Rodriguez et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems6040087). Despite competitive challenges, well-managed cover crop systems can actually enhance water availability during critical summer drought periods. Cover crops with significant biomass contribute to increased water availability through improved soil water-holding capacity and reduced evaporation from mulch plant residues, which may explain the higher soil water content verified in cover crops treatments during the critical drought summer months [(Martins et al._1, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13112674). These positive effects on soil water content during summer months play an important role in adequate tree physiological activity and thus in growth and crop yield [(Martins et al._1, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13112674). Long-term studies across different Mediterranean regions demonstrate that sustainable cover crop management can overcome climate-related challenges. In Italian semi-arid environments, trees managed under sustainable models with spontaneous cover crops produced almost constantly every year with average yields of 8.4 Mg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹, while traditionally managed plants showed lower production and strong yield alternation [(Santilli et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2011.6.S1.E15). The key lies in selecting cover crop species with asynchronous biological cycles relative to olive trees, where legumes have almost concluded their cycle when the biological activity of olive trees returns, minimizing competition for water and nutrients [(Martins et al._1, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13112674).
