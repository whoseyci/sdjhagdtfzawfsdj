## Introduction and Background

**Summary:** The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has evolved from a production-focused system to include environmental objectives through multiple instruments, with the recent introduction of eco-schemes representing a new intermediate approach between basic conditionality and intensive agri-environmental measures. (3 sources)

The Common Agricultural Policy has undergone significant transformation since the 1992 reforms, evolving from a blanket production-focused policy into a multi-targeted instrument that encompasses environmental objectives alongside food production support [(Medina, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.36920/ESA-V27N1-1). This evolution reflects the EU's commitment to promoting multifunctional farming systems that deliver both agricultural products and environmental goods and services. The CAP's environmental architecture operates through two main pillars with distinct approaches and funding mechanisms. The first pillar provides direct income support to farmers, with recent reforms tying 70% of payments to cross-compliance environment-related measures and 30% to greening instruments including crop diversification, permanent grassland maintenance, and ecological focus areas [(Medina, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.36920/ESA-V27N1-1). The second pillar, implemented through Rural Development Programs, represents 23% of the CAP budget and includes agri-environment schemes (AES) as the main environment-targeted policy instrument, with a minimum allocation of 25% of the RDP budget [(Medina, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.36920/ESA-V27N1-1). Despite these instruments, the CAP has failed to reverse biodiversity loss or markedly reduce European agriculture's environmental footprint, with critics pointing to low requirements, broad exemptions, unambitious scheme design, and imbalanced environmental investment [(Pe'er et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12901). To address these shortcomings, the post-2023 CAP introduces a new "Green Architecture" centered on three environmental instruments: enhanced conditionality, agri-environment-climate measures in Pillar 2, and new eco-schemes in Pillar 1 [(Pe'er et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12901). Eco-schemes represent a notable innovation as voluntary measures for farmers that Member States must fund with at least 20% of Pillar 1 payments in 2023-2024, increasing to 25% after 2025 [(Pe'er et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12901). These schemes are designed to operate as an intermediate instrument between basic conditionality standards and more complex agri-environmental measures, implemented annually with greater Member State flexibility in design compared to previous standardized approaches [(Thomas et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ERAE/JBZ014) [(Pe'er et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12901).

## Eco-schemes Design and Implementation

**Summary:** Eco-schemes represent a new voluntary CAP instrument that operates as an intermediate layer between basic conditionality and intensive agri-environmental measures, offering Member States significant flexibility in design while requiring mandatory implementation with at least 25% of Pillar 1 funding after 2025. (12 sources)

Eco-schemes constitute a novel environmental instrument introduced in the 2023-2027 CAP as part of the new "Green Architecture," designed to operate as an intermediate layer between enhanced conditionality requirements and more ambitious agri-environmental measures [(Was et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.30858/ZER/100702) [(Rac et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5424/sjar/2020183-16447). Unlike previous standardized approaches, eco-schemes grant Member States considerable flexibility in design and implementation, with the European Commission abandoning detailed EU-level regulations and leaving substantial freedom to Member States in designing agricultural practices beneficial for climate and environment [(Sadlowski, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.30858/zer/112133). The funding structure of eco-schemes represents a significant departure from traditional agri-environmental instruments. While agri-environment-climate measures (AECMs) under Pillar 2 are co-funded by national and regional authorities, eco-schemes are fully funded by the European budget through Pillar 1 direct payments [(Guyomard et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-023-01861-0). Member States must allocate at least 25% of their Pillar 1 budget to eco-schemes after 2025, following a "learning period" where the minimum requirement is 20% in 2023-2024 [(Falco et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land10080846) [(Roder et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2024.107219). This requirement can be reduced if Member States allocate at least 30% of their Pillar 2 budget to specific environmental objectives [(Roder et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2024.107219). A key innovation of eco-schemes lies in their payment structure, which offers two distinct approaches. Payments can be granted either as compensation for additional costs incurred or income foregone due to environmentally friendly practices (similar to AECMs), or as fixed top-up payments in addition to basic income support for sustainability (BISS), which are not necessarily linked to costs or income foregone [(Guyomard et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-023-01861-0). This second approach represents a first step toward payments for climate and environmental services, potentially exceeding the costs incurred or revenue lost from adopting these practices [(Detang-Dessendre et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12166462) [(Magaudda et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12062301). Eco-schemes are structured as annual commitments, distinguishing them from the multi-annual nature of traditional agri-environmental measures, though the 2021 agreement allows Member States to offer multi-annual payments [(Guyomard et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-023-01861-0) [(Falco et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land10080846). While mandatory for Member States to implement, participation remains voluntary for farmers, creating a "dual approach" where simpler environmental measures can be financed through Pillar 1 eco-schemes while more ambitious measures continue under Pillar 2 programs [(Was et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.30858/ZER/100702) [(Branzova, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.15547/tjs.2021.s.01.008). The scope of eco-schemes encompasses activities related to climate, environment, animal welfare, and antimicrobial resistance, with practices required to go beyond enhanced conditionality requirements and contribute to EU Green Deal targets [(Langlais, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41130-022-00183-1). Specific measures supported include agroforestry, carbon farming, precision farming, enhanced crop rotation, better fertilization, and implementation of ecological networks on farms [(Peeters et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3220/LBF1610123299000). The total EU budget allocated to eco-schemes amounts to €44.7 billion for the 2023-2027 period, with France receiving the largest absolute amount (€8.53 billion) and the Netherlands dedicating the highest share (32%) of their Pillar 1 budget [(Zielinski et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17062781).

## Comparison with Agri-Environmental Measures (Second Pillar)

**Summary:** Eco-schemes and agri-environmental measures represent two distinct but complementary approaches to environmental payments, differing in funding structure, commitment duration, and payment mechanisms, with eco-schemes serving as an intermediate layer between basic conditionality and more intensive Pillar 2 measures. (7 sources)

Eco-schemes and agri-environmental measures (AECMs) operate as complementary instruments within the CAP's environmental architecture, with notable differences in their structural design and implementation approach. While AECMs under Pillar 2 are co-funded by national and regional authorities, eco-schemes are fully funded by the European budget through Pillar 1 direct payments [(Guyomard et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-023-01861-0). This funding distinction creates different administrative frameworks and potential barriers to adoption for each instrument. The temporal structure of commitments represents a fundamental difference between these instruments. AECMs require long-term voluntary management commitments lasting five to seven years or beyond, while eco-schemes are implemented as annual commitments, though Member States can offer multiannual payments [(Nasiakou et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land11050598) [(Guyomard et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-023-01861-0). This annual structure in eco-schemes appeals to farmers' preference for short-term contracts and creates lower barriers to participation compared to the multi-year obligations of AECMs [(Buschmann et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2023.126418). Payment mechanisms differ significantly between the two instruments. AECMs follow the traditional approach of compensating farmers for additional costs incurred or income foregone due to environmentally friendly practices [(Nasiakou et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land11050598). Eco-schemes offer greater flexibility with two payment options: compensation for costs and income foregone (similar to AECMs), or fixed top-up payments in addition to basic income support that are not necessarily linked to costs or income foregone [(Guyomard et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-023-01861-0). This second approach represents a first step toward payments for climate and environmental services that may exceed actual costs incurred [(Guyomard et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-023-01861-0). The CAP's new Green Architecture positions eco-schemes as an intermediate instrument between enhanced conditionality and AECMs, creating a "dual approach" where simpler environmental measures can be financed through Pillar 1 eco-schemes while more ambitious and complex measures continue under Pillar 2 programs [(Pe'er et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12901). This complementarity allows for multiple payments for different actions on the same parcels, potentially enhancing uptake of more demanding habitat quality measures [(Pe'er et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12901). Both instruments share key characteristics in being mandatory for Member States to implement but voluntary for farmers to participate, with both requiring practices that go beyond enhanced conditionality requirements [(Falco et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land10080846) [(Branzova, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.15547/tjs.2021.s.01.008). However, eco-schemes differ in their universal character, potentially applying to all farmers across the EU-27 similarly to Pillar 1 direct payments, while AECMs typically focus on specific target areas with complex ecological requirements such as Natura 2000 sites [(Polakova et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13050620).

## Payment Rates and Budget Allocation

**Summary:** The CAP allocates substantial funding to environmental measures with eco-schemes requiring at least 25% of Pillar 1 budgets (€44.7 billion EU-wide for 2023-2027) and Pillar 2 environmental measures requiring 35% of rural development funds, though payment rates vary significantly across Member States and farm types. (8 sources)

The financial architecture of CAP environmental instruments reflects a significant commitment to green objectives through mandatory budget allocations across both pillars. Under the 2023-2027 CAP, Member States must allocate at least 25% of their Pillar 1 budget to eco-schemes after 2025, following a learning period where the minimum requirement is 20% in 2023-2024 [(Pe'er et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12901) [(Falco et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land10080846) [(Roder et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2024.107219). This requirement can be reduced if Member States allocate at least 30% of their Pillar 2 budget to specific environmental objectives [(Roder et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2024.107219) [(Zielinski et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17062781). The total EU budget allocated to eco-schemes amounts to €44.7 billion for the 2023-2027 period, with significant variation in allocation across Member States [(Zielinski et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17062781). France receives the largest absolute amount at €8.53 billion, while the Netherlands dedicates the highest share at 32% of their total Pillar 1 budget [(Zielinski et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17062781). This variation reflects different national priorities and agricultural structures across the EU. Complementing eco-schemes, Pillar 2 environmental funding has been strengthened with the earmarked allocation for environment-climate related instruments increased from 30% to 35% of total Pillar 2 contributions [(Roder et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2024.107219). Agri-environmental and climate measures drew almost 16.8% of all Rural Development expenditure in the 2014-2020 period [(Falco et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land10080846). Payment rate structures differ fundamentally between the two environmental instruments. The new Strategic Plan regulation waives maximum support rates for agri-environmental schemes defined in previous regulations, allowing higher payments that better reflect opportunity costs in regions with intensive agriculture [(Buschmann et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2023.126418). Payment levels need not be based solely on average opportunity and transaction costs but should consider area targets set by Member States to achieve environmental objectives [(Buschmann et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2023.126418). Eco-schemes offer two distinct payment approaches that represent a departure from traditional compensation models. Payments can be granted either as compensation for additional costs incurred or income foregone (similar to agri-environmental measures), or as fixed top-up payments in addition to basic income support that are not necessarily linked to costs or income foregone [(Guyomard et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-023-01861-0). This second approach represents a first step toward payments for climate and environmental services that may exceed actual costs incurred [(Guyomard et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-023-01861-0) [(Detang-Dessendre et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12166462). Historical analysis reveals that costs of fulfilling environmental requirements vary considerably among different farm types, with the majority of farmers' compliance costs lying well below the premium paid under previous greening measures [(Thomas et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ERAE/JBZ014). The CAP also provides flexibility through modulation mechanisms, allowing up to 15% of Pillar 1 budgets to be transferred to finance Pillar 2 measures such as agri-environmental schemes, though this does not necessarily result in more money for individual farmers but rather increased funding at the program level [(Thomas et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ERAE/JBZ014).

## Adoption Rates and Farmer Participation

**Summary:** Eco-schemes show varying adoption rates across EU Member States with farms in areas with natural constraints participating slightly less frequently than average, while the annual commitment structure and familiar first pillar framework are expected to create lower participation barriers compared to multi-year agri-environmental measures. (5 sources)

Farmer participation in eco-schemes varies considerably across the EU, reflecting differences in national implementation approaches and regional agricultural conditions. While eco-schemes are mandatory for Member States to implement, participation remains voluntary for farmers, creating a dual structure where uptake depends on both scheme design and farmer preferences [(Falco et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land10080846) [(Zielinski et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17062781). Current evidence suggests that eco-schemes have "taken hold to varying degrees in EU countries," with farms in areas with natural constraints (ANCs) participating slightly less frequently than farms overall [(Zielinski et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17062781). The structural design of eco-schemes creates several features that appeal to farmer participation preferences compared to traditional agri-environmental measures. The annual commitment structure appeals to farmers' preference for short-term contracts, contrasting with the five to seven-year commitments required for agri-environmental and climate measures (AECMs) [(Buschmann et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2023.126418) [(Falco et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land10080846). Additionally, farmers can modify the extent and location of their participation until mid-May each year, providing operational flexibility that reduces participation barriers [(Buschmann et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2023.126418). Farmer familiarity with first pillar support systems is expected to facilitate higher adoption rates for eco-schemes compared to equivalent second pillar measures. Since farmers are already familiar with the first pillar administrative framework, barriers to participating in eco-schemes are likely to be lower relative to comparable agri-environmental schemes in the second pillar, given similar measure content [(Buschmann et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2023.126418). This familiarity advantage is reinforced by the universal character of eco-schemes, which potentially apply to all farmers across the EU-27 similarly to other Pillar 1 direct payments [(Polakova et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13050620). Regional variations in adoption reflect underlying agricultural structural differences and farming practice baselines. Farmers from regions with disadvantaged agrarian structures face greater difficulties in implementing eco-schemes due to relatively low baseline levels of good agricultural practices in such areas [(Kiryluk-Dryjska et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/en15134529). However, these regional participation disparities can potentially be balanced through policy instruments such as increased redistributive payments that account for varying farmer capabilities and regional conditions [(Kiryluk-Dryjska et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/en15134529). The effectiveness of eco-schemes in achieving widespread adoption depends on continuous evaluation and adjustment to ensure proper implementation and optimal economic and environmental results [(Zielinski et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17062781). The variability in technical design across Member States will present challenges in assessing overall effectiveness when CAP Strategic Plans expire in 2027 [(Polakova et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13050620).

## Environmental Outcomes and Effectiveness

**Summary:** While the CAP has failed to reverse biodiversity loss or significantly reduce agriculture's environmental footprint, the new Green Architecture with eco-schemes represents a shift toward result-based payments and enhanced environmental monitoring, though effectiveness depends on ambitious design and continuous adaptation by Member States. (6 sources)

Despite decades of environmental instruments, the CAP has failed to reverse biodiversity loss or markedly reduce the environmental footprint of European agriculture [(Pe'er et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12901). Critics attribute this limited effectiveness to low requirements and broad exemptions in compulsory instruments, unambitious design of voluntary schemes, overpayment for ineffective environmental measures, and imbalanced investment in the environment compared to other objectives [(Pe'er et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12901). The new Green Architecture attempts to address these weaknesses through enhanced environmental monitoring and results-oriented approaches. The CAP now emphasizes greater flexibility in national programs and tailor-made solutions centered on environmental outcomes rather than activities, with environmental outcomes of farm practices assessed so that changes can be monitored over time and linked to payment delivery [(Pinto-Correia et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-12973-270139). This shift toward performance-based payments represents a departure from traditional activity-based payments in agri-environmental schemes [(Pinto-Correia et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-12973-270139). Result-based payment approaches show promise for improving environmental effectiveness, as they enable direct control of environmental impact by linking payments to outcomes rather than prescribed management measures [(Eichhorn et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2024.2364774). Research demonstrates that result-oriented schemes achieve much higher ecological performance than action-oriented approaches while providing greater management flexibility for farmers [(Eichhorn et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2024.2364774) [(Sabatier et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0033257). Several EU countries have already implemented result-based schemes, with Austria transferring a biodiversity conservation pilot into a full scheme and Germany programming a result-based scheme for flowering species in grassland as a First Pillar eco-scheme [(Eichhorn et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2024.2364774). However, significant risks remain for environmental effectiveness under the new system. Like most agri-environmental measures, eco-schemes will mainly rely on prohibited and required farming practices rather than on results and impacts [(Guyomard et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-023-01861-0). There is considerable risk of watering down environmental ambitions and windfall effects if Member States choose to fund primarily existing practices that should have been included under conditionality [(Pe'er et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12901). To maximize environmental benefits, Member States should use the opportunity of increased eco-scheme budgets to remove ineffective options and add missing effective options for biodiversity [(Pe'er et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12901). For biodiversity outcomes that develop over multiple years, Member States should consider multiannual agreements, bonus payments, or progressive payment systems, while short-term options should be monitored and reassessed to avoid undesirable effects [(Pe'er et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12901). The importance of reducing payments with limited environmental conditionality while increasing payments specifically aimed at promoting climate change mitigation and sustainable resource management has been confirmed through empirical analysis [(Frascarelli et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40100-025-00356-8).

## Monitoring and Evaluation Approaches

**Summary:** The CAP's new approach emphasizes performance-based payments and result-oriented monitoring that links environmental outcomes to payment delivery, though implementing these systems faces significant challenges in measuring environmental additionality and requires continuous evaluation to ensure proper implementation. (5 sources)

The CAP's monitoring and evaluation framework has shifted toward performance-based approaches that emphasize environmental outcomes rather than prescribed activities. The CAP now foresees greater flexibility in national programs and tailor-made solutions centered on results, with environmental outcomes of farm practices assessed so that changes can be monitored over time and linked to payment delivery [(Pinto-Correia et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-12973-270139). This represents a fundamental change from traditional activity-based payments toward performance-based payments in agri-environmental schemes [(Pinto-Correia et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-12973-270139). Result-based payment schemes are increasingly recognized as more effective monitoring approaches within the CAP framework. By linking payments to measurable environmental results rather than prescribed management measures, result-based schemes enable direct control of environmental impact and enhance conditionality by encouraging farmers to participate with land that produces the best environmental outcomes [(Eichhorn et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2024.2364774). Research confirms that result-oriented schemes achieve much higher ecological performance than action-oriented approaches while providing greater management flexibility for farmers [(Eichhorn et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2024.2364774) [(Sabatier et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0033257). Several EU countries have successfully implemented result-based monitoring systems, demonstrating practical applications of these approaches. Austria transferred a result-based pilot scheme for biodiversity conservation into a full scheme within their 2023-2027 Agri-environmental Programme, while Germany programmed a result-based scheme for flowering species in grassland as a First Pillar eco-scheme [(Eichhorn et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2024.2364774). Practical monitoring tools include field-based visual indicators that farmers can apply directly, covering aspects such as soil quality, pasture diversity, tree renewal, tree health, landscape elements, and biodiversity [(Pinto-Correia et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-12973-270139). However, implementing result-based monitoring faces significant challenges, particularly in assessing environmental and climate results achieved and establishing environmental additionality to justify payments in return for environmental results obtained [(Langlais, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41130-022-00183-1). The CAP regulation acknowledges these challenges while encouraging Member States to promote and support collective schemes and result-based payment schemes to deliver measurable environmental quality enhancement at larger scales [(Langlais, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41130-022-00183-1). Continuous evaluation remains essential for ensuring the effectiveness of both eco-schemes and monitoring systems. Eco-schemes must be continuously evaluated on farms to achieve correct implementation and deliver optimal economic and environmental results, with particular attention needed for multifaceted and environmentally ambitious schemes with attractive financing [(Zielinski et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su17062781). This ongoing evaluation requirement reflects the recognition that effective monitoring and evaluation approaches are critical for achieving the CAP's environmental objectives under the new Green Architecture.
