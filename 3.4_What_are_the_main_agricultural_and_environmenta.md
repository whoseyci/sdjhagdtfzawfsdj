**Research Query:** 3.4 What are the main agricultural and environmental policies implemented by the regional government of Andalusia (Junta de Andalucía) for olive production?

---

## Background

**Summary:** Andalusia dominates global olive production with 75% of Spanish output (35% globally), but faces major environmental challenges from soil loss and desertification that have prompted government action. The region's policy framework evolved from drought concerns and EU incentives in the 1990s, leading to joint public-private R&D programs and comprehensive legislation including master plans and CAP implementation.

Andalusia stands as the world's dominant olive-producing region, accounting for 75% of Spanish olive oil production, which represents approximately 35% of global production [(Neves et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18335/REGION.V5I1.219). Despite the region's shift toward more sustainable farming methods, including integrated and organic production systems, Andalusia continues to face significant environmental challenges, particularly severe soil loss issues [(Neves et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18335/REGION.V5I1.219). These environmental concerns prompted the Spanish government to implement both National and Andalusian Action Plans against Desertification, designed to promote good farming practices across the region [(Neves et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18335/REGION.V5I1.219). The policy framework governing Andalusian olive production emerged from specific historical pressures in the early 1990s, when the region experienced drought periods while the EU simultaneously offered CAP incentives to increase agricultural yields [(Neves et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18335/REGION.V5I1.219). These combined constraints and opportunities led to collaborative Research and Development programs launched in 1992 through joint initiatives between the Andalusian regional government and private olive producers, resulting in the development of advanced drip irrigation and fertilizer systems [(Neves et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18335/REGION.V5I1.219). The comprehensive legislative framework now includes multiple regulatory instruments, with the Master Plan for the Andalusian Olive Grove and Spain's Law on Olive Groves serving as key regional policies [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10110509). Spain's olive sector, encompassing over 2.5 million hectares and producing 1,285,000 tons of olive oil annually, operates under 29 Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) certifications, with 12 of these located specifically in Andalusia, reflecting the crop's critical importance to the region [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10110509). The Government of Andalusia has recognized the cultural and environmental significance of olive landscapes by proposing them for inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List due to their provision of multiple ecosystem services [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10110509).

## Regional Legislative Framework

**Summary:** Andalusia's olive production operates under extensive regional legislation centered on the Master Plan for the Andalusian Olive Grove and the Law of Olive Farming of Andalusia, which promote sustainable and competitive farming. These regional policies work through the Andalusian Rural Development Programme to implement specific olive grove support measures using EU funding. (3 sources)

The regional government of Andalusia has established a comprehensive legislative framework specifically designed to regulate and support olive production across the region. The cornerstone of this framework includes the Master Plan for the Andalusian Olive Grove and the Law of Olive Farming of Andalusia, which together form the primary regulatory instruments governing olive grove management practices [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10110509) [(Sousa et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11040665). The Law of Olive Farming of Andalusia specifically promotes sectoral policies that aim to create a "profitable, efficient, competitive and sustainable olive grove" [(Rivero et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13102630). The Master Plan for Olive Growing serves as the operational framework that guides implementation of these policies through the Andalusian Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014-2020. This programme includes specific sub-programmes dedicated exclusively to olive groves, which are funded through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) [(Rivero et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13102630). The Master Plan establishes a collaborative framework that requires all stakeholders connected to the olive sector to promote actions aligned with regional sustainability and competitiveness goals [(Rivero et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13102630). Within this regional framework, the Andalusian government has implemented targeted support measures for organic agriculture through Measure 11 (M11) of the Rural Development Programme. This measure includes two specific sub-measures: support for transitioning from conventional to organic production systems (M11.1.2) and continued development support for existing organic operators (M11.2.2), both designed to promote environmentally friendly production systems in compliance with EU organic production regulations [(Rivero et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13102630).

## EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Implementation

**Summary:** The EU's Common Agricultural Policy serves as the most impactful international policy framework for Andalusian olive production, having evolved from production-based subsidies to environmental sustainability focus through its two-pillar system. Current CAP implementation emphasizes "greening" payments that require 30% of direct payment budgets to support environmentally-friendly practices, driving the expansion of organic olive production in the region. (4 sources)

The European Union's Common Agricultural Policy represents the most significant international policy framework affecting Andalusian olive production, surpassing even regional legislation in its overall impact [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10110509). The CAP has undergone substantial reform since its early iterations, transitioning from production-based subsidies to a more environmentally-focused framework through the "2000 Agenda" reform, which restructured the policy around two main pillars: income support and rural development policies [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10110509). The current CAP framework specifically recognizes olive groves as multifunctional agricultural systems, with the second pillar incorporating payments based on the provision of non-productive ecosystem services [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10110509). This represents a fundamental shift from the earlier productivist approach, where single payments dominated the first pillar, to the current environmentally-friendly structure that allocates 30% of direct payment budgets to a "greening" regime [(Sousa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10110509). Under this greening framework, farmers with arable land must meet specific environmental obligations, including crop rotation and diversification requirements, while actively preserving environmental resources. The CAP's influence has been particularly notable in driving the expansion of organic olive production throughout Andalusia. The policy shift away from subsidies directly proportional to production toward encouraging sustainable agricultural practices has responded to both farmers' and society's demands for more environmentally responsible farming methods [(Sousa et al._1, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13147983). The current 2014-2020 CAP framework, along with future post-2020 prospects, specifically promotes agricultural practices that maximize crop sustainability and rural development on a regional scale, placing particular value on the non-productive ecosystem services that olive groves provide [(Sousa et al._1, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13147983) [(Buitenhuis et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1746-692x.12286). Implementation of CAP directives in Andalusia occurs through the regulatory framework established by EU Regulation 1305/2013, which guided the development of both the Andalusian Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014-2020 and the National Rural Development Programme for the same period [(Rivero et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13102630). These programmes operationalize CAP objectives through specific measures like M11 (Organic Agriculture), which focuses on supporting organic production systems and promoting environmentally friendly practices within the olive sector [(Rivero et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13102630).

## Environmental and Sustainability Initiatives

**Summary:** The Junta de Andalucía has implemented several key environmental initiatives including the National and Andalusian Action Plans against Desertification, agri-environmental schemes promoting groundcover establishment, and the creation of a specialized General Directorate of Ecological Agriculture. The region has also launched a comprehensive Circular Bioeconomy Strategy and promotes integrated production systems across olive groves. (6 sources)

## Institutional Framework and Support Systems

**Summary:** The Junta de Andalucía operates a complex institutional framework that includes local agricultural offices (OCAs), Rural Development Groups, and specialized support organizations like second-tier cooperatives and technical advisory associations. This system is supported by robust data management through SIGPAC and coordinated implementation of EU funding through regulatory boards and professional associations. (3 sources)

The institutional framework supporting olive production in Andalusia operates through a multi-layered system of regional and local organizations that provide technical support, regulatory oversight, and development coordination. At the local level, the Agricultural Administration of the Andalusian Government maintains Oficinas Comarcales Agrarias (OCAs), which serve as regional agricultural offices providing direct administrative support to olive producers [(Cendon et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2014124-6026). These offices work alongside Rural Development Groups and local branches of professional associations representing cooperatives, agricultural unions, and technical advisors [(Cendon et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2014124-6026). The system includes specialized cooperative structures designed to support olive oil production and marketing, particularly second-step cooperatives whose members are cooperative firms rather than individual farmers. Notable examples include Olivar de Segura in Sierra de Segura and Oleoestepa in Estepa, which focus primarily on bottling and marketing olive oil produced locally [(Cendon et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2014124-6026). These cooperatives work in coordination with Regulatory Boards that oversee quality standards and regional designation compliance [(Cendon et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2014124-6026). Technical support is provided through farmer associations such as ATRIAs (Agricultural Technical and Research Integration Associations) and APIs (Integrated Production Associations), which collectively contract agricultural technicians to provide specialized advice to olive farmers. ATRIAs focus primarily on conventional olive farming practices, particularly pest management, while APIs provide broader agricultural guidance on integrated production farming systems [(Cendon et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2014124-6026). The institutional framework operates under the collaborative structure established by the Master Plan for Olive Growing, which requires all stakeholders connected to the olive sector to promote aligned actions [(Rivero et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13102630). Implementation occurs through the Andalusian Rural Development Programme, which includes specific sub-programmes for olive groves funded through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development [(Rivero et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13102630). The system maintains high data reliability through the Agricultural Plots Geographical Information System (SIGPAC), which provides annual updates from growers applying for EU cultivation aids and maintains a comprehensive public register of agricultural plots [(Soltero et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.EGYR.2020.09.017).
