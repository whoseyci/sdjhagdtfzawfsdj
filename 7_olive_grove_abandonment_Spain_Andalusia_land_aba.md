## Background

**Summary:** Mediterranean agricultural systems, particularly in Spain's Andalusia region, face mounting pressures from post-WWII socio-economic changes that favor industrial agriculture over traditional small-scale farming. While Andalusia dominates global olive oil production, the sector increasingly confronts sustainability challenges from rural migration, low profitability, and the marginalization of small farms unable to compete with intensive operations.

Since World War II, fundamental shifts in European agricultural policy and economic priorities have reshaped Mediterranean farming landscapes. Socio-economic forces and governmental policies have combined to encourage agricultural intensification while accelerating the abandonment of remote agricultural communities, particularly across EU nations [(Zaferatos, 2011)](https://doi.org/10.5539/JSD.V4N1P23). This transformation has been driven by two key phenomena: EU industrialization and urbanization policies that drew workers from countryside to industrial centers, and the rise of industrialized agriculture that created competitive pressures small rural farms could not match [(Zaferatos, 2011)](https://doi.org/10.5539/JSD.V4N1P23). The resulting economic growth model has concentrated intensive farming primarily in coastal areas and accessible valley regions, while marginalizing traditional agricultural communities and their sustainable practices [(Zaferatos, 2011)](https://doi.org/10.5539/JSD.V4N1P23). Spain exemplifies these broader Mediterranean trends, serving as the world's leading olive oil producer with the largest concentration of olive agro-systems located in Andalusia [(Sousa et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy9120785). However, this dominant position masks growing sustainability concerns as rural migration, low profitability, and biophysical production limitations increasingly compromise the viability of these systems [(Sousa et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy9120785). While outright abandonment of Andalusian olive groves has remained relatively rare, many farms have responded to economic pressures by intensifying their practices, representing a shift away from traditional sustainable approaches [(Sousa et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy9120785).

## Land abandonment rates and trajectories in Andalusian olive systems

**Summary:** While complete abandonment of Andalusian olive groves has been relatively rare, Spain has experienced massive farm consolidation since EU entry, with over 3 million hectares disappearing from surveys between 2007-2016 due to cessation of activity, primarily affecting marginal and unprofitable operations. (5 sources)

Spain's agricultural landscape has undergone dramatic restructuring since joining the EU, with farm numbers declining by 32% between 1987 and 1997, accompanied by average farm sizes growing by 48.9% [(Molina et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-20900-1_4). This consolidation trend continued into the 21st century, though at a slower pace, with farm numbers decreasing by 14.2% between 1997-2007 and 9.9% between 2007-2016 [(Molina et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-20900-1_4). Most significantly, the period from 2007-2016 marked a critical shift where farm destruction was no longer accompanied by increases in remaining farm surface areas, indicating that over 3 million hectares simply disappeared from agricultural surveys due to cessation of activity and likely land abandonment [(Molina et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-20900-1_4). In Andalusian olive systems specifically, outright abandonment has been less common than in other Mediterranean crops, with farmers instead responding to economic pressures through intensification rather than abandonment [(Sousa et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy9120785). However, agricultural abandonment does occur among farmers with marginal and unprofitable olive farms, while others pursue intensification through increased chemical fertilizer use and irrigation [(Sousa et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13147983). This pattern contrasts sharply with other traditional crops like almonds, where significant portions of orchards have been abandoned due to low profitability and competition from countries like the USA [(Calatrava et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11050821). The abandonment trajectory varies significantly by farm characteristics and location. In mountainous and marginal areas, abandonment rates can be substantial - for example, in Mediterranean terraced systems, 56.33% of detected terraces were not cultivated in 2016, though this improved to 39.94% by 2019 [(Heider et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-020-01739-x). Small parcels tend to remain cultivated at higher rates than large or medium-sized parcels, likely because they are maintained by family farms where agriculture is not the primary income source and serves food security needs [(Heider et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-020-01739-x). However, the overall trend shows decreasing agricultural area in small and medium-sized parcels while large parcels expand [(Heider et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-020-01739-x).

## Economic decline patterns leading to abandonment

**Summary:** Economic decline in Mediterranean agriculture follows predictable patterns driven by insufficient farm income, fragmented holdings that escalate production costs, and market competition from large-scale industrial operations. Traditional olive farmers face a critical choice between abandoning agriculture entirely or intensifying practices to remain viable, with marginal areas and smaller farms experiencing the greatest economic pressures. (7 sources)

The fundamental driver of agricultural abandonment is insufficient farm income to sustain household reproduction, forcing farmers to either specialize in more profitable crops or intensify production [(Molina et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-20900-1_4). This income crisis stems from the sustained decline in agricultural product prices combined with an unequal distribution of income among farmers that is primarily determined by farm size [(Molina et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-20900-1_4). In olive systems specifically, the fragmented structure of traditional farms hampers competitiveness by escalating production costs, while intensive farming has pulled down overall market prices, making most traditional olive farms barely viable or even unviable [(Gomes et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12073059). Traditional olive farmers typically follow one of two main economic trajectories in response to these pressures: either abandoning traditional farming practices to move toward more profitable intensive or super-intensive models, or searching for alternative economic opportunities outside agriculture, which consequently results in further farmland abandonment [(Gomes et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12073059). The abandonment option is particularly common among smaller farms located in marginal areas, especially in mountain zones where yields are lower and production costs are higher [(Santilli et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2011.6.S1.E15). Multiple interconnected factors compound the economic decline in marginal areas. Land fragmentation results in higher transaction costs for farmers, while the lack of interest among younger generations in continuing agricultural activities creates succession problems [(Heider et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-020-01739-x). Market competition with large-scale industrial agriculture in surrounding areas further disadvantages small traditional operations, and the lack of modernization leaves them unable to compete effectively [(Heider et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-020-01739-x). The economic crisis has created distinct regional patterns, with marginal areas experiencing progressive abandonment due to lower production capacity [(Paz et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/insects13010048). In contrast, some crops like almonds have experienced more severe abandonment than olives, with significant portions of almond orchards abandoned due to low profitability and competition from countries like the USA [(Calatrava et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11050821). Even farmers who do not abandon their land entirely often engage in extensification and disinvestment, representing a form of gradual economic withdrawal despite their reluctance to quit farming completely [(Zagaria et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-017-1276-4).

## Farm size and adoption of sustainable practices relationship

**Summary:** Research consistently shows that larger, more profitable farms are significantly more likely to adopt sustainable and conservation practices than smaller operations. Economic constraints force smaller farms to prioritize short-term survival over long-term sustainability investments, creating a clear relationship between farm economic capacity and environmental stewardship. (3 sources)

Farm size emerges as a key predictor of sustainable practice adoption, with larger operations demonstrating both higher adoption rates and broader implementation of conservation measures. Economically large farms show a clear proclivity for adopting a wider range of agri-environmental programs (AEPs), while economically smaller farms typically focus on a narrower spectrum of sustainable practices [(Vaclavik et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad4efa). This pattern is particularly pronounced among the smallest operations, where farms with economic values below 2,000 EUR account for 70% of all farms with no agri-environmental program uptake [(Vaclavik et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad4efa). The underlying mechanism driving this relationship centers on economic capacity and time horizons. Lower income farmers are typically more concerned with short-term survival than with the long-term benefits of soil conservation, while more profitable farms that are less dependent on EU subsidies are more likely to maintain conservation infrastructure like stonewalls because they can bear the maintenance costs [(Leyva et al., 2007)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2007053-246). Research in Andalusia specifically confirms that more profitable farms are significantly more likely to adopt soil conservation measures, with farm size serving as a positive predictor of conservation adoption [(Serebrennikov et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12229719). This relationship becomes particularly critical in Mediterranean environments where conservation needs are high. In southern Spain's arid climate, where an estimated 48% of soil faces moderate-to-severe erosion risk, adopting conservation strategies represents a viable option to increase both soil productivity and farm profitability - but primarily for farms with sufficient economic resources to make the initial investments [(Serebrennikov et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12229719).

## Evidence of inverse adoption patterns in vulnerable farms

**Summary:** The most economically vulnerable farms—those with the greatest need for sustainable practices—are paradoxically the least likely to adopt them due to resource constraints and survival-focused decision-making. This creates a concerning inverse relationship where environmental benefits concentrate among already-secure larger operations while marginal farms become trapped in cycles of disinvestment and extensification. (4 sources)

The evidence reveals a clear inverse adoption pattern where the farms most vulnerable to economic and environmental pressures are least able to implement the conservation practices they need most. Economically smaller farms usually focus on a narrower spectrum of agri-environmental programs, and farms with economic values below 2,000 EUR account for 70% of all farms with no agri-environmental program uptake [(Vaclavik et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad4efa). This pattern stems from fundamental resource constraints, as lower income farmers are usually more concerned with short-term survival than with the long-term benefits of soil conservation, while more profitable farms that are less dependent on EU subsidies can bear the costs of maintaining conservation infrastructure [(Leyva et al., 2007)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2007053-246). The consequences of this inverse adoption create particularly troubling trajectories in marginal areas. Production abandonment is particularly common in smaller farms located in marginal areas, mostly in mountain zones where yields are lower and production costs are higher [(Santilli et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2011.6.S1.E15). These vulnerable farmers become "disengaged," demonstrating low management intensity and high frequency of disinvestments that suggest a continuation of extensification and abandonment, despite their reluctance to quit farming entirely [(Zagaria et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-017-1276-4). This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where the farms facing the greatest environmental challenges—such as soil erosion in steep terrain—have the least capacity to implement the conservation measures that could address these problems. Policy interventions often inadvertently reinforce these inverse patterns. Grant-in-aid systems that advantage large landowners further concentrate resources among already-secure operations [(Santilli et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2011.6.S1.E15). Meanwhile, cross-compliance obligations may actually lead to more abandonment among vulnerable farms, as they lack the resources to meet regulatory requirements while maintaining profitability [(Santilli et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2011.6.S1.E15). This inverse adoption pattern represents a critical sustainability challenge, as it concentrates environmental improvements among farms that may need them least while leaving the most vulnerable landscapes without adequate conservation measures.
