## Introduction: Spanish River Basin Governance Context

**Summary:** Spain's water governance system divides management between river basin authorities that handle water resources and agricultural ministries that oversee farming, creating potential coordination challenges. This split structure can lead to conflicts between water protection goals and agricultural development needs, especially in regions like Andalusia where farming is economically important. (LLM Memory)

Spain operates under a dual governance system where river basin authorities manage water resources while agricultural ministries handle farming policies and soil management . This institutional separation creates inherent tensions between water conservation objectives and agricultural development goals, particularly in water-stressed regions like Andalusia where agriculture represents a major economic sector . River Basin Management Plans are required under EU Water Framework Directive to integrate various water uses, but the fragmented institutional structure can complicate implementation when water and soil management decisions involve multiple authorities with different mandates and priorities . The system's effectiveness depends heavily on coordination mechanisms between these separate institutions, yet the political influence of agricultural producer organizations and the economic importance of farming can create pressures that may undermine integrated water-soil governance approaches .

## River Basin Authorities' Mandates and Institutional Structure

**Summary:** Spanish river basin authorities have broad mandates covering water allocation, infrastructure development, and basin management plans, but operate within a fragmented system where different agencies handle water versus agricultural policy. These authorities control water access through licensing systems and drought management, but face coordination challenges across government levels and policy areas. (3 sources)

Spanish river basin authorities operate with comprehensive mandates that evolved significantly following the 1985 Water Act, which established water boards responsible for designing hydrological management plans, with approval authority resting with the Spanish Ministry of Public Works [(Leeuwen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2019.01.018). The Spanish National Water Plan granted national administrative control over continental waters as public domain, giving authorities state control over access to both surface and groundwater resources [(Leeuwen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2019.01.018). River basin authorities like the Confederación Hidrográfica del Ebro (CHE), established in 1926 as one of the world's earliest river basin authorities, demonstrate the institutional structure's complexity, operating as autonomous organizations under ministerial oversight while engaging multiple stakeholders including government organizations, communities, civil society representatives, and private sector actors such as energy producers and agribusinesses [(Moumen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.9770/ird.2019.1.4(2)). These authorities maintain dual responsibilities: promoting infrastructure development for agricultural and economic growth while achieving environmental objectives mandated by EU Water Framework Directive requirements for good ecological status of water bodies [(Moumen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.9770/ird.2019.1.4(2)). The operational structure grants river basin authorities significant control over water allocation through licensing systems, where private water use requires rights granted under River Basin Management Plans, allowing extraction up to maximum annual volumes though without guaranteeing availability [(Gutierrez-Martin et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-022-03228-8). During drought periods, these authorities implement hierarchical water rationing that prioritizes urban uses over agricultural uses, applying proportional restrictions primarily to agricultural water rights holders who represent the majority of water rights in Spanish basins [(Gutierrez-Martin et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-022-03228-8). However, this institutional arrangement creates inherent coordination challenges due to vertical fragmentation between government levels and horizontal fragmentation among agencies operating in different policy areas such as agriculture, water management, climate change, and regional development [(Moumen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.9770/ird.2019.1.4(2)).

## Evidence of Institutional Fragmentation and Coordination Challenges

**Summary:** Research shows that river basin authorities face significant coordination problems both vertically between government levels and horizontally across different policy areas like agriculture and water management. These coordination failures stem from overlapping jurisdictions, competing mandates, and the absence of clear mechanisms to integrate water and soil management across institutions. (3 sources)

The fragmentation in Spanish water governance reflects broader European patterns where coordination mechanisms between government levels remain inadequate. Italian experience demonstrates similar challenges, where the transfer of water competences to regional administrations "occurred without clear coordination mechanisms between the two levels," leading to conflicts that weakened river basin authorities when regions perceived basin management reforms as central government interference in their water and soil management competences [(Pellegrini et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w11091804). These institutional tensions created barriers to integrated water-soil management even when legal frameworks like Italy's Law 183/1989 attempted to establish coordinated basin-level planning. Spanish river basin authorities like the Confederación Hidrográfica del Ebro face similar coordination barriers when "competing demands for water resources across different levels of government operating in different policy areas—such as agriculture, water, climate change and regional development" create institutional disconnects [(Moumen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.9770/ird.2019.1.4(2)). These coordination problems manifest through both vertical fragmentation between government levels and horizontal fragmentation among agencies operating at the same administrative level, creating structural barriers to effective collaboration between water authorities and agricultural ministries [(Moumen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.9770/ird.2019.1.4(2)). The coordination challenges are compounded by the "very limited level of integration of policies (which often show direct or indirect side-effects) and to the limited level of interaction among stakeholders" in river basin management [(Giordano et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132571). This fragmentation particularly affects the integration of water management with agricultural policy, where different institutional mandates and stakeholder engagement processes can work at cross-purposes rather than supporting coordinated water-soil governance approaches.

## Agricultural Influence in Water Governance Decision-Making

**Summary:** Agricultural users hold significant influence in Spanish river basin governance due to their control over the vast majority of water concessions, giving them disproportionate power in decision-making processes. The governance structure of river basin authorities like the Ebro includes agricultural stakeholders as core participants, creating a system where farming interests are directly embedded in water management institutions. (2 sources)

The dominance of agricultural water use translates directly into political influence within Spanish river basin governance structures. In regions like Andalusia, agriculture uses over 90% of the water concessions, which means "agricultural users traditionally have had more influence than others on the governing board and therefore in the decision-making process" [(Ballester et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W8070273). This structural advantage gives agricultural interests significant leverage over water allocation decisions and management priorities. River basin authorities are designed as collaborative institutions that formally include agricultural stakeholders as key participants rather than external interests to be regulated. The Confederación Hidrográfica del Ebro operates "as a partnership of private users and public authorities" where "CHE engages not only government organizations but also communities, local authorities, representatives of civil society and the private sector, such as energy producers and agribusinesses" [(Moumen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.9770/ird.2019.1.4(2)). This partnership structure means agricultural producer organizations and agribusinesses have institutionalized roles in water governance rather than being subject to external oversight. The embedded nature of agricultural influence reflects the historical development of Spanish river basin authorities, which were originally created with "the main objective was to promote and coordinate the construction and operations of infrastructure to support agricultural development and economic growth" [(Moumen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.9770/ird.2019.1.4(2)). This foundational purpose of promoting agricultural development continues to shape institutional relationships, even as authorities have taken on additional environmental mandates under EU Water Framework Directive requirements.

## Limitations in Available Evidence and Documentation Gaps

**Summary:** The available research literature shows significant gaps in documenting specific coordination failures between Spanish water and agricultural authorities, with most studies focusing on technical water allocation rather than political economy aspects. Many papers acknowledge institutional fragmentation exists but provide limited concrete evidence of how agricultural producer organizations influence policy or how authorities avoid enforcement responsibilities. (6 sources)

The research literature reveals substantial documentation gaps regarding the specific mechanisms of institutional coordination failures in Spanish river basin management. Multiple studies acknowledge that fragmentation exists but fail to provide detailed evidence of coordination breakdowns between water and agriculture authorities [(Pellegrini et al._1, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W11040833) [(Torregrosa et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.2495/EI-V2-N4-346-355) [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12061835). While researchers note that "geographical, river basin, territorial, administrative and political borders do not coincide" and refer to "management shared among different public administrations," the specific documentation of coordination failures, institutional conflicts, or political economy aspects remains largely undocumented [(Torregrosa et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.2495/EI-V2-N4-346-355). The available studies tend to focus on technical aspects of water allocation and rationing methods rather than examining soil governance mandates, institutional coordination issues, or political influence dynamics [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12061835). Even when research identifies "very limited level of integration of policies" and "limited level of interaction among stakeholders" in river basin management, these observations lack the detailed analysis needed to understand how agricultural producer organizations exercise political influence or how authorities navigate competing mandates [(Giordano et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132571). Comparative examples from other European contexts, such as guidance recommending integration of wetlands into River Basin Management Plans under the Water Framework Directive, suggest that coordination challenges between water and agricultural policies are widespread [(Manton et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND10020174). However, the literature provides limited country-specific documentation of how these coordination challenges manifest in Spanish institutional contexts, particularly regarding the role of agricultural ministries and producer organizations in influencing water-soil governance decisions [(Tabara et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10010161).
