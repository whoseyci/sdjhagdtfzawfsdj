## Background and Context

**Summary:** Cover crops are plants grown between main crop seasons that can store carbon in soil, which helps fight climate change. In Mediterranean areas with hot, dry summers, understanding how well cover crops work for long-term carbon storage is important for sustainable farming. (LLM Memory)

Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration through cover crops has emerged as a key strategy for climate change mitigation and sustainable agriculture. Cover crops are non-cash crops planted during fallow periods or between main crop rotations to provide ground cover and improve soil health . These crops capture atmospheric carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and convert it into organic matter that can be stored in soil for extended periods . The process of SOC accumulation involves complex interactions between plant residue inputs, microbial decomposition, and soil physical protection mechanisms that determine how much carbon remains sequestered over time . Mediterranean climates present unique challenges and opportunities for SOC sequestration due to their distinct seasonal patterns of hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, which influence both cover crop growth and decomposition processes . Long-term field experiments are essential for understanding SOC dynamics because carbon sequestration is a slow process that can take years to decades to show measurable changes, and short-term studies often fail to capture the full picture of carbon storage potential and stability . These experiments help researchers understand not only how much carbon can be stored, but also how long it remains in the soil and what factors control its persistence under different management practices and climate conditions .

## SOC Accumulation and Sequestration Rates from Cover Crops

**Summary:** Cover crops can increase soil carbon storage at rates of 0.32-1.19 tons per hectare per year, with effects becoming more apparent after 3-5 years and continuing for decades, though the highest rates occur in early years and then slow down over time. (11 sources)

Meta-analyses of cover crop experiments worldwide consistently show notable carbon sequestration benefits, with global sequestration rates typically ranging from 0.32 ± 0.08 to 0.56 Mg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ [(Sharma et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.4236/AJPS.2018.99140) [(Guenet et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15342) [(Sahu et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5772/INTECHOPEN.97337) [(Domagala-Swiatkiewicz et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13165-021-00383-x) [(Ma et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022EF003142). These rates represent significant carbon storage potential, with cover cropping estimated to compensate for 8% of annual direct greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture [(Sahu et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5772/INTECHOPEN.97337). Studies covering observation periods up to 54 years show that cover crops can increase SOC stocks by 13.8%-17.3% compared to fallow periods [(Ma et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022EF003142). The type of cover crop influences sequestration rates, with legume cover crops typically outperforming non-legumes. Research shows legume cover crops increase SOC by 5.9% while non-legume cover crops increase it by 4.0% [(He et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44264-025-00050-8). Higher sequestration rates have been documented in some regional studies, such as 0.45 t C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ in the Pampa Region and rates as high as 1.19 t C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ for specific cover crop species like Persian clover [(Cambareri et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoil.2023.1092003) [(Peregrina et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2014124-5818). Critical temporal patterns emerge from long-term studies showing that SOC increases become more apparent 5 years after implementing cover crop management, with effects detectable in short-term experiments but showing greater variation in long-term trials exceeding 10 years [(Novara et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.18172/CIG.3794) [(He et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44264-025-00050-8). The sequestration process is non-linear, with the highest annual rates occurring in early years following cover crop introduction, then decreasing over time as soils approach a new equilibrium [(Guenet et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15342) [(Seitz et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11104-022-05438-w). Modeling suggests that 50% of the total SOC effect occurs within the first 20 years, with carbon sequestration potentially lasting for more than 100 years under green manure scenarios [(Kazimierczuk et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsengineeringau.3c00031). However, cover crops alone may not be sufficient to turn all croplands from carbon sources to carbon sinks, particularly in systems experiencing underlying negative SOC trends, though they effectively reduce SOC losses during fallow periods [(Seitz et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11104-022-05438-w).

## Long-term Field Experiment Results

**Summary:** Long-term studies spanning 12-54 years show cover crops consistently increase soil carbon, with effects becoming clear after 5 years and continuing for decades, though results vary by soil depth, tillage practices, and management combinations. (8 sources)

Long-term field experiments provide robust evidence of cover crop effectiveness for SOC sequestration across diverse conditions and time scales. A notable 12-year study demonstrated that cover crops increased SOC stocks compared to treatments without cover crops across different tillage systems, including no-till, chisel plow, and moldboard plow treatments, with sequestration occurring throughout the topsoil, subsoil, and entire root zone [(Olson et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.4236/OJSS.2014.48030). Meta-analyses incorporating experiments up to 54 years in duration show consistent linear SOC accumulation at rates of 0.32 ± 0.08 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, with modeling suggesting steady-state SOC accumulation of 16.7 ± 1.5 Mg ha⁻¹ after 155 years of continuous cover cropping [(Sharma et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.4236/AJPS.2018.99140). Critical temporal thresholds emerge from long-term observations, with a 21-year Mediterranean citrus plantation study showing that SOC increases become more apparent 5 years after implementing cover crop management [(Novara et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.18172/CIG.3794). However, shorter-term experiments may not capture the full effects, as demonstrated by a 4-year Mediterranean study where cover crops did not yet produce detectable SOC impacts, suggesting longer observation periods are needed [(Farina et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjss-2023-0106). The depth distribution of SOC changes varies significantly with management practices. While some studies show increased carbon stocks in surface layers (0-30 cm), deeper soil responses can be inconsistent. A 19-year experiment revealed that cover crops combined with mineral fertilizer increased carbon stocks by 3.5% above 30 cm but decreased carbon by 7% over the entire 2-meter profile [(Rath et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5194/SOIL-2021-19). In contrast, combining cover crops with composting increased carbon stocks by 5% above 30 cm and 12.6% over the full 2-meter profile, suggesting important interactions between cover crops and other management practices [(Rath et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5194/SOIL-2021-19). Diversified rotational systems incorporating cover crops show enhanced performance compared to monocultures, with potential carbon sequestration rates of 216 ± 117 kg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ in topsoils when compared to single cropping systems [(Tiefenbacher et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11050882). Long-term modeling studies project that fields with cover crops could accumulate 0.28-0.33 Mg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ over 50 years, though the effectiveness depends on underlying soil carbon trends and regional conditions [(Seitz et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11104-022-05438-w) [(Skinuliene et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture14030483).

## SOC Dynamics and Decomposition Processes

**Summary:** Cover crops affect soil carbon through complex processes involving different carbon pools - they increase both stable and easily decomposed carbon fractions, with decomposition rates influenced by residue quality, microbial activity, and environmental conditions. The balance between carbon inputs from cover crop biomass and carbon losses through decomposition determines net carbon storage. (12 sources)

Cover crops influence SOC dynamics through their effects on multiple carbon pools with different stability and decomposition characteristics. Meta-analyses show that cover crops increase mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) by 4.8%, particulate organic carbon (POC) by 23.2%, and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) by 20.2% in topsoils, demonstrating that cover crops feed into both stable and more labile carbon pools [(Fohrafellner et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13472). The stratification of SOC with depth reflects the concentration of different carbon fractions, with graminaceous cover crops showing particular efficiency in biomass production and carbon input, leading to positive carbon balance in both total organic carbon and easily degradable labile fractions [(Landriscini et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3232/SJSS.2020.V10.N2.03). Decomposition processes are strongly influenced by residue quality and environmental conditions. Residue characteristics such as carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, lignin content, and particle size control decomposition rates, with cover crop residues stimulating carbon mineralization regardless of cover crop type [(Ghimire et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU9122316). Laboratory studies demonstrate varying decomposition rates, with winter cover crops retaining 73% of their carbon after 127 days compared to 52% retention for summer cover crops, leading to SOC increases of 13.8-39.1% following complete winter-summer cover crop cycles [(Wang et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.4236/JEP.2010.12010). The relationship between carbon inputs and microbial processes creates complex dynamics affecting net carbon storage. While cover crops increase carbon inputs through biomass production, they also enhance microbial activity and associated CO₂ losses through both autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration [(Bista et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e27904). Leguminous cover crops particularly enhance soil microbial activity, facilitating organic matter degradation, while spontaneous vegetation with carbon-rich residues like lignin exhibits greater stability and slower decomposition rates [(Michail et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture15080898) [(Bechara et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.2166/WCC.2018.082). The mineral nitrogen availability for organic matter decomposition accelerates and advances the decomposition process, while cover crop management practices that reduce soil disturbance and maintain surface residues decrease plant residue contact with soil heterotrophic microorganisms, promoting SOC accumulation in upper soil layers [(Domagala-Swiatkiewicz et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13165-021-00383-x) [(Peregrina et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2014124-5818) [(Reicosky et al., 1995)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00224561.1995.12456959). However, the effects on SOC dynamics can vary significantly based on environmental conditions and management approaches. Some studies show that while cover crops may have limited effects on total SOC in certain environments, they can nearly double the active microbial component that contributes to SOC stabilization [(Novara et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12083256). Long-term studies indicate that while residue quality affects short-term carbon dynamics, it does not substantially affect long-term carbon storage, with legume cover crops leading to higher soil carbon storage and slower decomposition in no-till systems [(Avery, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.101411).

## Mediterranean Climate Considerations

**Summary:** Mediterranean climates create unique challenges for cover crop carbon sequestration due to hot, dry summers and variable rainfall, requiring longer observation periods (5+ years) and site-specific management approaches that consider soil texture, water availability, and seasonal growing conditions. (7 sources)

Mediterranean climates present distinct challenges and opportunities for cover crop-based SOC sequestration due to their characteristic hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Research in Mediterranean environments shows that cover crop effectiveness varies significantly based on site-specific factors, with soil texture and climate serving as key determinants of carbon storage potential [(Zumkeller et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.1024606). In sandy soils, cover crop type and tillage practices show little influence on net ecosystem carbon balance, while finer-textured soils respond more favorably to higher biomass-producing cover crops [(Zumkeller et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.1024606). The temporal requirements for detecting SOC changes are extended in Mediterranean systems compared to other climates. A notable 21-year Mediterranean citrus study demonstrates that SOC increases become apparent only 5 years after implementing cover crop management, with sequestration rates ranging from -1.10 to 1.89 Mg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ over the observation period [(Novara et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.18172/CIG.3794). Similarly, a 4-year Mediterranean study found that cover crops did not produce detectable SOC impacts, reinforcing the need for longer observation periods in these climates [(Farina et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjss-2023-0106). Water limitations in semiarid Mediterranean environments can constrain cover crop effectiveness. Studies in semiarid vineyards show that while cover crops can double the active microbial component contributing to SOC stabilization, they may have limited effects on total SOC, suggesting that temporary cover crop applications may not optimize ecosystem services in dry environments [(Novara et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12083256). However, when successfully established, cover crops in Mediterranean systems show significantly higher dry biomass production and carbon content compared to natural vegetation, indicating enhanced carbon storage potential [(Tul et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijpb13030020). The type of cover crop influences decomposition dynamics differently in Mediterranean climates. Spontaneous vegetation produces less biomass than seeded cover crops but exhibits greater stability due to carbon-rich residues like lignin, requiring more time for decomposition and mineralization [(Michail et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture15080898) [(Bechara et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.2166/WCC.2018.082). Conversely, leguminous cover crops enhance soil microbial activity and facilitate organic matter degradation, though this increased activity may offset some carbon gains [(Michail et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture15080898). These findings suggest that proper management protocols specifically designed for Mediterranean dry environments need development to optimize cover crop ecosystem services under water-limited conditions [(Novara et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12083256).

## Soil Quality Indicators and Co-benefits

**Summary:** Cover crops provide multiple soil health benefits beyond carbon storage, including improved soil structure, increased microbial activity, better water infiltration, enhanced nitrogen availability, and reduced erosion, with these effects often requiring 4-15 years to become fully apparent. (7 sources)

Cover crops deliver substantial co-benefits for soil quality indicators beyond carbon sequestration. Key soil health improvements include: • **Soil Physical Properties**: Cover crops significantly improve soil aggregation, infiltration rate, and soil structure, with these benefits observed in 15-year experiments combining no-till and cover crop practices [(Sharma et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.4236/AJPS.2018.99140). Cover crops also reduce soil erosion by an average of 68% annually while increasing SOC stock by 14% in the top 15 cm [(Huang et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.70133). • **Microbial Activity and Biomass**: Cover crops increase microbial biomass carbon (MBC) by 20.2% in topsoils and enhance overall soil microbial activity [(Zhang et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16296). The multidimensional benefits are particularly pronounced when cover crops are combined with manure applications, resulting in higher fractions of labile SOC [(Doyeni et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy14123024). • **Nutrient Cycling**: Cover crop treatments increase soil nitrogen levels, with SOC at 0-30 cm depth providing 120-130 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ in cover crop treatments compared to 0 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ without cover crops [(Sharma et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.4236/AJPS.2018.99140). Cover crops also increase levels of soluble nitrogen and water extractable organic carbon [(Farina et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjss-2023-0106). • **Labile Carbon Fractions**: Cover crops increase various forms of readily bioavailable organic carbon, including water extractable organic carbon (WEOC), soil microbial biomass carbon (SMB-C), and dissolved organic carbon, which represent the most active components of SOC [(Doyeni et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy14123024). • **Cash Crop Yield Benefits**: Greater SOC content from cover crops fosters improved soil health and indirectly increases cash crop yields, with cover crop treatments showing 13-30% greater yields than no-cover crop controls [(Bista et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e27904) [(Acharya et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-16719-w). • **Biological Activity**: Cover crops increase biological activities of microbes and enhance soil enzyme activities, contributing to overall soil biological health [(Sharma et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.4236/AJPS.2018.99140) [(Farina et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjss-2023-0106). These soil quality improvements contribute to long-term sustainability of agricultural systems, with cover cropping and reduced tillage representing viable farming practices to protect soil and reduce carbon losses under various climatic conditions [(Farina et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjss-2023-0106).

## Factors Influencing SOC Sequestration Success

**Summary:** The success of soil carbon sequestration with cover crops depends on biomass production levels, soil texture, climate conditions, tillage practices, cover crop species selection, and management combinations, with fine-textured soils and higher biomass production generally showing better results. (11 sources)

The amount of plant carbon added to soil through cover crops serves as the primary driver of SOC sequestration success, with total plant carbon additions translating into 10-20 Mg C ha⁻¹ greater SOC content compared to no-cover crop controls [(Chahal et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70224-6). Higher biomass-producing cover crops significantly enhance carbon storage potential, with studies showing that annual cover crop biomass production above 7 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ results in 30% higher total soil carbon stocks than lower biomass production levels [(Fohrafellner et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13472) [(McClelland et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2278). Soil texture emerges as a critical determinant of cover crop effectiveness for carbon sequestration. In sandy soils, cover crop type and tillage practices show little influence on net ecosystem carbon balance, while fine-textured soils respond more favorably to cover crops due to smaller pore sizes and organic-mineral complexes that reduce soil organic matter exposure to microorganisms for mineralization [(Zumkeller et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.1024606) [(Cambareri et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoil.2023.1092003). The capacity for SOC sequestration is more pronounced in soils with medium texture compared to other soil types [(Skinuliene et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture14030483). Climate conditions, particularly temperature and precipitation, strongly influence cover crop carbon sequestration success. Mean annual temperature serves as the primary predictor of SOC changes, with warmer climates generally promoting greater sequestration rates [(He et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44264-025-00050-8). Weather conditions constrain plant biomass production, ground covering, and biomass carbon input into soil, leading to carbon deficits in some environments [(Skinuliene et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture14030483). The precipitation-to-temperature ratio provides essential indicators for understanding cover crop residue decomposition in different environments [(Cambareri et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoil.2023.1092003). Management practices significantly modify SOC sequestration outcomes through their interactions with cover crops. The adoption of no-till or reduced tillage with cover crops enhances carbon storage by minimizing soil disturbance and promoting residue retention, which slows decomposition [(Dasgupta et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.9734/arja/2024/v17i4577) [(Kumar et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.9734/cjast/2020/v39i3331017). Conservative tillage combined with cover crops during rotation cycles provides enhanced benefits for SOC sequestration, with leguminous cover crops particularly increasing biodiversity, residue feed efficiency, and SOC pooling [(Kumar et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.9734/cjast/2020/v39i3331017). Cover crop species selection influences sequestration success, with nitrogen fertilizer application rates, soil pH interactions, and soil bulk density affecting outcomes [(Kazimierczuk et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsengineeringau.3c00031). The timing of cover crop management also matters, as planting and termination dates determine the growing window, which serves as one of the strongest predictors of SOC response to cover cropping [(Fohrafellner et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13472) [(McClelland et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2278). Water availability represents a particular constraint in dryland systems, where SOC cycling is primarily limited by biomass carbon inputs, and improvements in SOC storage are primarily observed in areas where water is not a limiting factor for crop production [(Ghimire et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU9122316). However, residue quality characteristics such as carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, lignin content, and particle size strongly influence decomposition rates regardless of environmental conditions [(Ghimire et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU9122316).
