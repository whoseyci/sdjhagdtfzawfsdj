## Introduction and Regional Context

**Summary:** The Axarquía region of Málaga province has emerged as a key subtropical crop production area in Europe, with avocado cultivation becoming the most widespread tropical crop since the 1970s. This coastal Mediterranean region combines favorable climate conditions with intensive agriculture focused on high-value crops like avocados and mangoes. (3 sources)

The province of Málaga, particularly its coastal Axarquía region, represents one of the most important subtropical crop production areas in Europe. Avocado cultivation began to establish itself along the southern Spanish Mediterranean coast in the early 1970s and has since become the most widespread tropical crop in the area, occupying approximately 8,350 hectares with an average annual production of around 70,000 metric tons [(Sayadi et al., 2005)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2005032-137). The province of Málaga provides representative weather conditions and agricultural practices that are characteristic of avocado cultivation throughout the European Union, making it a significant case study for subtropical crop expansion [(Anastassiadou et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2020.6240). The Axarquía area has developed economically through intensive agriculture focused on high-value subtropical crops, creating a distinctive agricultural landscape that coexists with urban development pressures from the nearby metropolitan area of Málaga [(Jimenez et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.21138/bage.3297). This region exemplifies the agricultural transformation occurring in Mediterranean coastal areas, where traditional farming systems have been replaced by intensive subtropical crop production systems that require specialized management practices and significant water resources.

## Agricultural Expansion and Land Use Change

**Summary:** The Axarquía region has experienced rapid subtropical crop expansion since the 1990s, with avocado plantations growing from 4,500 to 7,000 hectares and mango from 500 to 4,100 hectares by 2021. This expansion has displaced traditional crops and extended beyond regulated irrigation zones into higher elevations, creating unsustainable agricultural intensification. (3 sources)

The agricultural transformation of the Axarquía has involved the systematic replacement of traditional crops across different elevations. In the plains, sugar cane and potato production have been displaced by subtropical cash crops, while in the hinterlands, traditional almond groves have been converted [(Drescher, 1995)](https://doi.org/10.3989/PIRINEOS.1995.V145-146.144). The foothills have been extensively terraced and converted to plastic greenhouse production for early vegetable cultivation, creating an almost completely transformed landscape [(Drescher, 1995)](https://doi.org/10.3989/PIRINEOS.1995.V145-146.144). The scale of subtropical crop expansion has been substantial, with roughly 40% of Spanish avocado plantations (8,000 hectares) and 90% of mango plantations (4,250 hectares) now concentrated in Málaga Province's Axarquía region (Junquera et al., 2024). Between 1999 and 2021, avocado cultivation expanded from 4,500 to 7,000 hectares, while mango plantations grew dramatically from 500 to 4,100 hectares (Junquera et al., 2024). The most rapid expansion occurred in the early 2000s following the extension of dam irrigation infrastructure in 1999, with mango plantations spreading particularly fast between 2005-2014 despite market price fluctuations (Junquera et al., 2024). This intensive agricultural development has resulted in the region recording the lowest percentage of suitable area (5.3%) for further expansion, as irrigated agriculture has greatly intensified and become devoted to tropical fruits including avocado, mango, custard apple, and papaya [(Gutierrez et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13115971). The expansion has extended beyond regulatory boundaries, with individual users illicitly extending irrigation pipelines from dam distribution networks into higher elevations, sometimes hundreds of meters above the 140-meter regulatory limit (Junquera et al., 2024). This lack of integrated management and absence of regulatory mechanisms to impose irrigation area limits based on available water resources has led to unsustainable expansion of irrigated crops in the region (Junquera et al., 2024).

## Water Demand and Resource Management

**Summary:** The expansion of subtropical crops in Axarquía has created unsustainable water demands, with avocado trees being particularly water-intensive and plantations expanding into previously rainfed areas. The region now faces severe water stress with overexploited aquifers and critically low reservoir levels, requiring new water sources like desalination and reclaimed water to maintain agricultural productivity. (3 sources)

The intensive water requirements of subtropical crops have created significant resource management challenges in the Axarquía region. Avocado trees are substantial water users relative to other fruit trees due to their congenital features, leading to increased demand for sustainable water-saving measures in Mediterranean climates where irrigated avocado orchards are common [(Rodriguez et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13051049). While subtropical fruit trees were initially planted in irrigated areas around river basins where they displaced horticultural crops with comparable water requirements, their subsequent expansion into higher-elevation rainfed areas has significantly increased the overall water demand (Junquera et al., 2024). The region's water infrastructure has been stretched beyond its intended capacity. Dam water use has extended beyond regulatory boundaries as individual users have illicitly extended pipelines from distribution networks into higher elevations, sometimes hundreds of meters above the 140-meter regulatory limit (Junquera et al., 2024). The absence of regulatory mechanisms to impose irrigation area limits based on available water resources has led to unsustainable expansion of irrigated crops throughout the region (Junquera et al., 2024). The water crisis has reached critical levels, with prolonged drought leading to historically low levels in the region's sole reservoir (La Viñuela) while groundwater levels have significantly declined, indicating overexploited aquifers [(Hurtado et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13122156). This crisis impacts water supply for residents, threatens agricultural productivity, and places considerable environmental strain on the region [(Hurtado et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13122156). Farmers have adapted by applying deficit irrigation techniques, while regional planning anticipates introducing 19.5 cubic hectometers of reclaimed water and 25 cubic hectometers of desalinated water to balance excess demand and replace overextracted groundwater [(Hurtado et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13122156).

## Environmental and Agricultural Impacts

**Summary:** The intensive subtropical crop expansion in Axarquía has caused significant environmental degradation including heavy erosion, destruction of natural vegetation, and landscape "sterilization" through terracing and plastic greenhouse construction. The agricultural transformation has created substantial waste management challenges with crops producing large amounts of pruning waste annually, while steep terrain cultivation on terraces adds further environmental stress.

The agricultural transformation of the Axarquía has resulted in severe environmental consequences that extend far beyond water resource depletion. The conversion to intensive subtropical crop production has caused heavy erosion and destruction of large parts of the natural vegetation, leading to the "sterilization" of the landscape and contributing to overexploitation of natural water resources [(Drescher, 1995)](https://doi.org/10.3989/PIRINEOS.1995.V145-146.144). The establishment of terraced landscapes for plastic greenhouses and subtropical fruit cultivation has fundamentally altered the region's topography, with cultivation now occurring on slopes that vary between 30 and 60% where crops are located on flat terraces [(Reyes-Martin et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/app12010193). The intensive agricultural system generates significant organic waste streams that create additional environmental management challenges. Subtropical crops within the region produce substantial amounts of pruning waste annually - approximately 40 kg per tree per year for avocado, 25 kg per tree per year for cherimoya, and 10 kg per tree per year for mango [(Reyes-Martin et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021859621000113). Given the scale of cultivation, with thousands of hectares now devoted to these crops, the total volume of agricultural waste requiring management represents a substantial environmental burden. The environmental pressures are compounded by pollution from agricultural inputs and infrastructure. The intensification of land use has proven problematic not only for water resources and natural vegetation but also for soil conservation, with frequently occurring water shortages accompanied by heavy pollution of the environment from plastic residues and pesticides [(Drescher, 1995)](https://doi.org/10.3989/PIRINEOS.1995.V145-146.144). These environmental impacts raise questions about the long-term sustainability and profitability of the current production systems, as the region continues to experience considerable environmental strain from the combined pressures of agricultural intensification, water scarcity, and growing population demands [(Hurtado et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13122156).
