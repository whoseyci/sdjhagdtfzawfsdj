## Introduction/Background

**Summary:** Socio-technical transitions theory explains how society shifts from old ways of doing things to new sustainable practices through complex interactions between technology, institutions, and social behaviors. This field emerged to understand why sustainable innovations often struggle to replace established systems despite being better for the environment. (LLM Memory)

Socio-technical transitions theory developed as researchers sought to understand how societies can shift toward more sustainable ways of organizing economic and social activities . The field recognizes that major changes in areas like energy, transport, or agriculture involve more than just new technologies - they require coordinated changes in regulations, user practices, infrastructure, markets, and cultural meanings . Sustainability transitions specifically focus on long-term structural changes that address environmental challenges while meeting human needs . These transitions are particularly challenging because existing systems often become "locked-in" through various mechanisms including economic investments, institutional arrangements, and behavioral patterns that make change difficult even when better alternatives exist . The field draws insights from innovation studies, evolutionary economics, and sociology to explain why some sustainable innovations succeed in transforming entire sectors while others remain marginalized .

## Multi-Level Perspective Framework

**Summary:** The Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) is the most widely used framework for understanding sustainability transitions, organizing analysis around three nested levels - niches (protected spaces for innovation), regimes (dominant stable systems), and landscapes (broad external pressures) - that interact to create windows of opportunity for systemic change. (18 sources)

The Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) has emerged as the most prominent and influential theoretical framework for analyzing socio-technical transitions to sustainability [(Hausknost et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11020506) [(Sovacool et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0306312717709363). Originally developed by Rip and Kemp in the 1990s and later refined by Frank Geels, the MLP provides a heuristic framework for understanding the multi-dimensional complexity of changes in socio-technical systems [(Bilali, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE9040074) [(Pinardi et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci12070398) [(Fastenrath et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10072434). The MLP conceptualizes transitions as non-linear processes resulting from interactions across three nested analytical levels that differ in their degree of structuration and stability [(Angheloiu et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14606925.2017.1352827) [(Trindade et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10010067) [(Horan et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11030558). At the micro-level, **niches** serve as "protected spaces" or "incubation rooms for radical novelties" where innovative activities take place away from the harsh selection pressures of dominant systems [(Seyfang et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2015.1063603) [(Binks et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12020557). These include R&D laboratories, subsidized demonstration projects, and small market niches where users have special demands and are willing to support emerging innovations [(Hausknost et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11020506) [(Trindade et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10010067). At the meso-level, **socio-technical regimes** represent the dominant, semi-coherent set of rules, practices, and structures that stabilize existing socio-technical systems [(Bui, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13116135) [(Corsini et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.4013/sdrj.2021.141.19). Regimes encompass technologies, institutions, actors, cognitive routines, shared beliefs, user practices, and regulatory arrangements that coordinate activities and maintain dynamic stability [(Bilali, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE9040074) [(Hausknost et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11020506). These systems rarely undergo radical transformation and tend to change only incrementally due to strong path dependencies and lock-in effects [(Bilali, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE9040074) [(Konefal, 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU7010612). At the macro-level, the **socio-technical landscape** encompasses the broader, slowly changing exogenous context that actors cannot directly influence in the short term [(Hausknost et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11020506) [(Trindade et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10010067). This includes demographic trends, political ideologies, societal values, macro-economic patterns, climate change, wars, and cultural shifts [(Bilali, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE9040074) [(Binks et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12020557). The MLP's core insight is that transitions occur through the dynamic interplay of these three levels rather than from any single level alone [(Jackson et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3390/RESOURCES3030516) [(Mitake et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1017/dsd.2020.110). A typical transition pattern involves niche innovations building up internal momentum while landscape changes create pressures that destabilize the existing regime, thereby creating windows of opportunity for niche innovations to gain traction and potentially replace the dominant regime [(Hausknost et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11020506) [(Bilali, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE9040074) [(Ruhrort, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU12198253). This framework emphasizes that transitions are co-evolutionary processes involving technological, social, institutional, and economic systems rather than purely technological changes [(Patterson et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.EIST.2016.09.001) [(Kivimaa et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2022.102971).

## Socio-Technical Regimes

**Summary:** Socio-technical regimes are the stable, dominant configurations that maintain existing systems through formal and informal rules, practices, and institutions. They resist change through various lock-in mechanisms and path dependencies, which explains why sustainable innovations struggle to replace established ways of doing things. (12 sources)

Socio-technical regimes represent the core structural element of the Multi-Level Perspective, forming the "deep structure" that accounts for the stability and persistence of existing socio-technical systems [(Hausknost et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11020506) [(Reda et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.segy.2021.100054). Regimes are defined as semi-coherent sets of rules, routines, and structures that coordinate and guide the activities of social groups in reproducing various elements of socio-technical systems [(Bilali, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE9040074) [(Konefal, 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU7010612). These systems encompass far more than just technology - they include networks of actors, formal and informal institutions, cognitive routines, shared beliefs, user practices, regulatory arrangements, and material infrastructures that work together to maintain system stability [(Kivimaa et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1007/S12053-017-9547-Y) [(Hausknost et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11020506). The defining characteristic of regimes is their resistance to fundamental change and tendency toward incremental evolution rather than radical transformation [(Bilali, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE9040074) [(Koning et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13042297). This stability is maintained through multiple lock-in mechanisms that create path dependencies, making it difficult and costly to shift to alternative configurations even when better options exist [(Beltran et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13073896) [(Reda et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.segy.2021.100054). These lock-in effects operate through techno-economic investments in existing infrastructure, social and cognitive routines that shape how actors perceive problems and solutions, and institutional and political arrangements that favor established approaches [(Beltran et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13073896). Regimes exhibit "dynamic stability" - they are not static entities but continuously reproduce themselves through the coordinated activities of regime actors while adapting incrementally to pressures and changes [(Reda et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.segy.2021.100054) [(Augenstein et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ADMSCI6010001). This reproduction occurs through structuration processes where regime elements mutually reinforce each other and respond to external pressures in ways that maintain overall system coherence [(Hodson et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU9020299). The regime concept helps explain why transformative change toward sustainability is so challenging - incumbent actors with vested interests typically use their power and resources to prevent fundamental changes that might threaten their positions [(Augenstein et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ADMSCI6010001). Within the MLP framework, regime transformation occurs when landscape pressures create destabilization that opens windows of opportunity for niche innovations to gain traction and potentially reconfigure or replace existing regime structures [(Lopez et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12010101) [(Corsini et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.4013/sdrj.2021.141.19). This process requires not just technological change but coordinated shifts across all dimensions of the regime, including institutions, actor networks, practices, and cultural meanings [(Runhaar et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eist.2020.06.001) [(Beltran et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13073896).

## Niches and Niche Innovations

**Summary:** Niches are "protected spaces" where radical innovations can develop away from mainstream market pressures, serving as incubation rooms for alternative technologies and practices that may eventually challenge dominant regimes. These spaces are crucial for sustainability transitions because they provide the seeds for systemic change through experimentation, learning, and network building. (11 sources)

Niches represent the micro-level of the Multi-Level Perspective and constitute the "locus of radical innovation" where path-breaking technologies and practices emerge [(Bilali, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE9040074) [(Hausknost et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11020506). These are conceptualized as "protected spaces" such as R&D laboratories, subsidized demonstration projects, or small market niches where users have special demands and are willing to support emerging innovations that deviate from existing regimes [(Hausknost et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11020506) [(Trindade et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10010067). The fundamental characteristic that defines niches is their protective function - they shield experimental projects with radical innovations from the harsh selection pressures of incumbent regimes [(Seyfang et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09537325.2015.1063603). This protection allows innovations to mature and develop internal momentum before facing full market competition [(Loorbach et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1146/ANNUREV-ENVIRON-102014-021340). Without this protective environment, many sustainable innovations would fail to gain traction against established systems with significant advantages in terms of infrastructure, user familiarity, and institutional support. Niches serve multiple critical functions beyond simple protection. They act as "incubation rooms" or "testbeds" where actors can engage in new practices and proactively deviate from regime rules and routines [(Augenstein et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ADMSCI6010001) . Key processes within niches include articulating expectations about new technologies, creating new networks of actors, and facilitating shared learning about innovations [(Kivimaa et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1007/S12053-017-9547-Y). These processes provide nurturing for new innovations, making them more likely to succeed against the preferences embedded in dominating regimes. Within the transition dynamics framework, niches are considered crucial because they provide the seeds for systemic change [(Hausknost et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11020506). The MLP suggests that niche-innovations must build up internal momentum through knowledge production processes, performance improvements, and support from powerful civil society groups before they can effectively challenge existing regimes [(Sobratee et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14063280). This process of momentum building is essential for creating windows of opportunity when landscape pressures destabilize incumbent regimes. The relationship between niches and regimes is characterized by embedding - niches are embedded within regimes, which are in turn embedded within landscapes [(Trindade et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10010067) [(Binks et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12020557). This nested structure means that niche innovations must eventually interact with and potentially transform regime structures to achieve broader systemic impact. The transition occurs when niche innovations that have developed sufficient internal momentum can take advantage of regime destabilization created by landscape pressures [(Bilali, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE9040074). Strategic Niche Management has emerged as a governance approach specifically designed to foster innovation within these protected spaces, helping radical innovations develop without being subject to the selection pressures of prevailing regimes [(Melchior et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13020528) [(Pinardi et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci12070398). This approach emphasizes the importance of creating and nurturing these spaces where alternative technologies, practices, and governance arrangements can develop and gain momentum to eventually challenge dominant technological regimes.

## Landscape Pressures

**Summary:** Landscape pressures are broad, slowly-changing external forces like climate change, economic crises, cultural shifts, and political developments that create destabilization pressures on existing regimes. These macro-level forces are largely beyond the control of individual actors but can create windows of opportunity for niche innovations to challenge dominant systems. (11 sources)

The socio-technical landscape represents the macro-level of the Multi-Level Perspective and encompasses the broader exogenous context that actors at niche and regime levels cannot influence in the short run [(Hausknost et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11020506). This level includes demographic trends, political ideologies, societal values, macro-economic patterns, environmental problems, cultural attitudes, wars, and climate change [(Bilali, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE9040074) [(Binks et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12020557) [(Trindade et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10010067). The landscape is characterized as an exogenous environment of slowly changing cultural norms, values, and structures that represent the indisputable backdrop of society [(Dedeurwaerdere, 2014)](https://doi.org/10.4337/9781783474561.00011) [(Perez-Lancellotti et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/1203/3/032011). What distinguishes landscape pressures analytically is their external nature - they present forces that regime and niche actors have little or no direct control over, particularly in the short term [(Hausknost et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11020506) [(Peter, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137360). The landscape level is typically the most structured and stable over time, evolving slowly through prolonged stages, though it can occasionally change quickly through events like wars, economic recessions, or oil price fluctuations [(Hodson et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU9020299) [(Medina-Molina et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127197). The critical function of landscape pressures within transition dynamics is their ability to destabilize existing regimes and create windows of opportunity for change [(Bilali, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE9040074) [(Peter, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137360). These pressures can generate opportunities for niches while simultaneously representing sources of pressure that threaten regime stability [(Bilali, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE9040074). When landscape changes couple with sufficiently developed niche innovations, they can trigger fundamental socio-technical transitions [(Sica, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.17265/1548-6583/2016.02.004). This process creates the conditions where niche innovations that have built up internal momentum can break through to challenge and potentially replace established regimes [(Hodson et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU9020299) [(Hausknost et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11020506). Landscape pressures operate through multiple channels, exerting influence on regimes through social, political, and economic pathways [(Sica, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.17265/1548-6583/2016.02.004). These broader contextual developments can act as forcing factors that drive change in regimes by pressuring them to adapt their internal structures, processes, and functions [(Peter, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137360). The interaction between landscape pressures and other levels is what makes transitions non-linear processes rather than predictable, mechanical changes [(Mitake et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1017/dsd.2020.110) [(Medina-Molina et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127197).

## Transition Dynamics and Pathways

**Summary:** Transition dynamics are non-linear, multi-phase processes that occur through complex interactions between niches, regimes, and landscapes over multiple decades. These transitions follow various pathways depending on timing, conditions, and the alignment of developments across all three levels, with some transitions becoming stalled or locked-in rather than reaching completion. (13 sources)

Transition dynamics represent the core mechanisms through which socio-technical systems transform from one stable configuration to another through non-linear, co-evolutionary processes [(Bilali, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE9040074) [(Patterson et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.EIST.2016.09.001). These transitions are fundamentally **multi-dimensional, multi-actor, long-term, and co-evolutionary processes** characterized by path dependency, resistance to change, uncertainties, and disagreements between incumbent and new actors [(Nora et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.24857/rgsa.v15.2784). The defining characteristic of transition dynamics is their **dialectic interaction processes** occurring at the niche-regime-landscape interface [(Bilali, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE9040074). A typical transition pattern unfolds when niche-innovations build up internal momentum while landscape changes create pressures that destabilize socio-technical regimes, creating windows of opportunity for niche innovations to take center stage and potentially replace existing regimes [(Bilali, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE9040074) [(Hausknost et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11020506) [(Trindade et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10010067). Transitions are understood as **multi-decade shifts** that occur through systems co-evolving in processes of cyclical and iterative change [(Jackson et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3390/RESOURCES3030516) [(Hodson et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU9020299). These processes involve **multiple phases** rather than simple linear progression, with transitions research tracing disruptive technological pathways through pre-development phases, followed by acceleration and eventual stabilization of new regimes [(Kivimaa et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2022.102971) [(Jackson et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3390/RESOURCES3030516). Importantly, not all transition processes lead to complete system transformation. **Various transition pathways can arise, not all of which constitute 'complete' transition** as pathways may become stalled or locked-in along the way [(Patterson et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.EIST.2016.09.001). This recognition has led researchers to conceptualize different transition pathways based on empirical case studies, acknowledging the diverse ways in which landscape pressures, regime responses, and niche developments can interact [(Loorbach et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1146/ANNUREV-ENVIRON-102014-021340) [(Angelis, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s43615-021-00133-x). The acceleration of socio-technical transitions involves **three mutually reinforcing processes**: increasing momentum of niche innovation, weakening of existing systems, and strengthening of exogenous pressures that create windows of opportunity [(Horan et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11030558). Successful sustainable transitions require both reflexive and shared knowing and doing, engaging processes of co-design and social learning among diverse stakeholders [(Jackson et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3390/RESOURCES3030516). Transition dynamics emphasize that fundamental change involves far more than technological substitution - they encompass coordinated shifts across technological, social, institutional, and economic dimensions [(Patterson et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.EIST.2016.09.001) [(Beltran et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13073896). This systemic nature means transitions represent **radical, structural changes** resulting from co-evolution of economic, cultural, technological, ecological and institutional developments at different scale levels [(Angheloiu et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14606925.2017.1352827).

## Applications to Agricultural and Sustainability Transitions

**Summary:** Socio-technical transitions theory has been widely applied to understand sustainability challenges across sectors like energy, agriculture, urban development, and food systems. These applications demonstrate how the Multi-Level Perspective helps analyze real-world transformation processes, particularly in agricultural transitions toward more sustainable practices like agroecology. (12 sources)

The sustainability transitions framework has found extensive application across multiple sectors as researchers and practitioners seek to understand and facilitate transformation toward more sustainable socio-technical systems [(Kivimaa et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1007/S12053-017-9547-Y) [(Svensson et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12052129) [(Runhaar et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eist.2020.06.001). These transitions address the fundamental challenge that **sustainability transitions require radical, deep-structural transformations** rather than incremental changes or technological fixes alone [(Runhaar et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eist.2020.06.001). **Agricultural transitions** represent a particularly important application domain, where the Multi-Level Perspective has been used to analyze the shift toward more sustainable farming systems [(Tapsoba et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY10091447) [(Sobratee et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14063280). The **agroecological transition** exemplifies a systemic transformation of agriculture and food systems that involves far more than technological change [(Tapsoba et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY10091447) [(Duru et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1684/AGR.2014.0691). In this context, agricultural niches include innovations like agroecology, organic agriculture, permaculture, conservation agriculture, and alternative food networks that develop away from the dominant industrial agricultural regime [(Sobratee et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14063280) [(Bilali, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE9040074). The established regime represents conventional, industrial agriculture with its **well-established set of norms, stakeholders, policies, markets and research** that creates stability but also lock-in effects [(Tapsoba et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY10091447). Beyond agriculture, the framework has been applied to **energy system transitions**, particularly in analyzing the shift toward renewable energy systems like district heating [(Reda et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.segy.2021.100054). Urban sustainability transitions have also been examined, including innovative approaches like **urban acupuncture** strategies that use small-scale interventions as niche experiments to create leverage for broader urban adaptation to climate change [(Perez-Lancellotti et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/960/4/042072). The Multi-Level Perspective has proven particularly valuable for analyzing **established economic sectors such as energy, food, transport, or mobility** that face sustainability challenges [(Ayala et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14169831). These applications emphasize the importance of **purposive experimentation within sociotechnical niches** to accelerate transformative change [(Ayala et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14169831) [(Wirth et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09654313.2018.1504895). Research has shown that transitions involve **multilevel, multiphase processes of structural change** during which dominant social structures come under pressure from both external societal changes and endogenous innovations [(Ayala et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14169831) [(Jun et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-016-9760-4). The framework's strength lies in its ability to capture **coevolutionary complexity and critical phenomena such as path-dependency, emergence, and nonlinear dynamics** while highlighting changes across technologies, institutional structures, business models, organizations, and policies [(Ayala et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14169831). However, empirical applications have also revealed limitations, particularly in agro-food research where scholars have noted challenges in clearly operationalizing regime boundaries and transition pathways, with many highlighting the **inadequacy of standard transition pathways for the agro-food sector** [(Sobratee et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14063280) [(Bilali, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE9040074). This has led to calls for more integrative conceptualization and operationalization of MLP elements to accommodate the complexity and peculiarities of specific sectors.
