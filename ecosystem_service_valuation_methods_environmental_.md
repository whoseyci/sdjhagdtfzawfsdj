## Introduction to Ecosystem Service Valuation

**Summary:** Ecosystem service valuation assigns monetary values to benefits that ecosystems provide to humans, using market-based methods when prices exist or non-market techniques to estimate willingness to pay. This economic framework helps integrate environmental benefits into policy decisions and natural capital accounting. (12 sources)

Ecosystem service valuation represents a fundamental approach to quantifying the economic benefits that natural systems provide to human society. The field focuses on estimating the impacts of changes in ecosystem services on individual welfare, with benefits and costs approximated using monetary values based on willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA) concepts [(Koundouri et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/frevc.2023.1160118). This valuation process has become crucial for effective integration between conservation and development policies, allowing ecosystem services to be included in cost-benefit analyses and conventional accounting at local, national, and regional levels [(Notaro et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-023-01839-4) [(Souliotis et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-021-01478-7) [(Cavalletti et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2021.1955664) [(Vargas et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-018-1110-x). The valuation framework recognizes that ecosystems generate several different types of benefits for humans, including direct consumption benefits, indirect support for other goods and services, and non-consumptive values such as intrinsic and existence values - together comprising the total economic value of ecosystem services [(Nicolette et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU5052152). This comprehensive approach extends beyond simple ecological valuation based on biological and physical aspects to encompass economic valuation grounded in consumer preferences and well-being measures [(Latawiec et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.2478/agriceng-2022-0004) [(Maes et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3897/ONEECO.3.E24720). Economic values are estimated through multiple pathways: market transaction values where they exist, parallel market transactions that associate indirectly with ecosystem services, or consumer willingness to pay for ecosystem goods and services [(Pandeya et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.ECOSER.2016.10.015). The methodological approaches fall into three main categories: direct market valuation for services with established economic values, indirect market valuation using techniques that reveal willingness to pay when explicit markets don't exist, and contingent valuation through survey questionnaires describing hypothetical situations [(Ferreira et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.4136/ambi-agua.2531). The valuation methodology builds upon notable frameworks including the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment natural capital framework and The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity typology, which classify ecosystem goods and services into categories reflecting specific benefits to people [(Batker et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w16152121) [(Power, 2010)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2010.0143).

## Valuation Frameworks and Typologies

**Summary:** Multiple systematic frameworks have emerged to categorize ecosystem services and their valuation methods, with the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and TEEB being foundational approaches. These frameworks organize ecosystem services into categories like provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural services, while classifying valuation methods into market-based, revealed preference, and stated preference approaches. (3 sources)

The development of ecosystem service valuation has been structured around several key typological frameworks that provide systematic approaches for categorizing both ecosystem services and their valuation methods. Costanza's pioneering 1997 work established 17 types of global ecosystem services, including product provisioning, air, soil, hydrologic regulation, biological conservation, and cultural services, completing valuations for each service based on the public's willingness to pay [(Wu et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13073822). Since this foundational work, valuation methods have continuously evolved from subjective and objective evaluation approaches including WTP and market value methods to material conversion-based evaluation methods including energy conversion and equivalent factor approaches [(Wu et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13073822). Two major frameworks have become particularly influential in structuring ecosystem service valuations. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment natural capital framework establishes four major categories: provisioning services, regulating services, supporting services, and cultural services, while The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity typology classifies ecosystem goods and services into categories reflecting specific benefits to people [(Batker et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w16152121). The TEEB framework provides a basis for monetary valuation by assessing total economic value, defined as "the sum of values of all flows of services generated by natural capital, both now and in the future, discounted appropriately" [(Krzemien et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20010381). For valuation methodology classification, frameworks typically organize approaches into three main categories: market valuation, revealed preference, and stated preference methods [(Krzemien et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20010381). Alternative classification systems divide valuation methods into eight categories grouped into equivalent factor method and non-equivalent factor method types, with the latter including market price method, shadow price method, avoided cost method, replacement cost method, travel cost method, contingent valuation and choice experiment methods [(Krzemien et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20010381). These standardized frameworks facilitate comparison across studies and support decision-making processes, though researchers note that calculated values often present wide variations and discrepancies depending on the assumptions made and methods used [(Krzemien et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20010381).

## Market-Based Valuation Methods

**Summary:** Market-based valuation methods use existing market prices or production relationships to estimate ecosystem service values, including direct market pricing for traded services, production function approaches that measure ecosystem contributions to economic output, and cost-based methods that estimate replacement or restoration expenses. (8 sources)

Market-based valuation methods represent the most straightforward approach to ecosystem service valuation when market transactions or production relationships exist. These methods are divided into three main approaches within the direct market valuation category: market price-based approaches, cost-based approaches, and production function approaches [(Selivanov et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.17221/96/2021-jfs). **Market Price-Based Approaches** - **Direct market prices**: Uses the prices of ecosystem services that are traded on markets as a proxy for their monetary value, particularly effective for provisioning services whose products are usually sold in existing markets [(Selivanov et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.17221/96/2021-jfs) [(Kermagoret et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0205935) - **Adjusted market prices**: When market prices are adjusted to correct for market distortions such as taxes and subsidies [(Selivanov et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.17221/96/2021-jfs) [(Bateman et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.1007/S10640-010-9418-X) - **Related market pricing**: In cases where direct market prices are not available, prices may be estimated using market prices in related markets, such as using prices of final goods that combine ecosystem services with other inputs by subtracting the cost of other inputs [(Zheng et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-023-01948-8) [(Ouyang et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1911439117) **Production Function Approaches** - **Factor income method**: Natural assets are treated as inputs to production of other goods, estimating the value of non-marketed resources in terms of changes in economic activity by modeling the physical contribution to economic output [(Sarvasova et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.2478/cass-2014-0008) [(Nijnik et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3897/ONEECO.2.E14808) - **Production enhancement**: Estimates how much a given ecosystem service contributes to the enhancement of income or productivity [(Kermagoret et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0205935) **Cost-Based Approaches** - **Replacement cost method**: Estimates costs incurred by replacing ecosystem services with artificial technologies [(Sarvasova et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.2478/cass-2014-0008) - **Restoration/mitigation costs**: Refers to the cost of mitigating effects caused by loss of ecosystem services or restoring those services [(Sarvasova et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.2478/cass-2014-0008) - **Avoided cost method**: Based on preventive expenditures that would be necessary if ecosystem services didn't exist [(Nijnik et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3897/ONEECO.2.E14808) - **Relocation costs**: Uses costs of relocating threatened communities as a proxy for ecosystem service values [(Sarvasova et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.2478/cass-2014-0008) **Opportunity Cost Method** - Uses the value of alternative environmental goods for ecosystem valuation, assessing the value relinquished to protect, enhance or create an environmental asset, such as loss of revenue from protecting forest from agricultural clearance [(Sarvasova et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.2478/cass-2014-0008) Market-based methods have the advantage of using data from actual markets to reflect actual preferences or costs to individuals, making them largely objective and based on observed market transactions [(Kermagoret et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0205935) [(Marta-Pedroso et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3897/ONEECO.3.E26722). These approaches work particularly well in well-functioning markets where supply and demand determine appropriate price levels [(Nijnik et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3897/ONEECO.2.E14808).

## Revealed Preference Methods

**Summary:** Revealed preference methods infer ecosystem service values by analyzing actual human behavior and choices in existing markets, including travel costs to recreational sites, property price premiums for environmental amenities, and indirect valuation through related market transactions. (10 sources)

Revealed preference methods extract the individual willingness to pay or accept by examining the choices that people make within existing markets, using information on human behavior in markets such as travel or housing to estimate the value of related ecosystem services [(Heckwolf et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142565) [(Milon et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W11071518). These indirect methods value ecosystems based on participants' behavior in influenced markets, using linkages with market goods or services to assess willingness to pay [(Sarvasova et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.2478/cass-2014-0008). Revealed preference methods involve analyzing individuals' choices in real-world settings and inferring value from those observed choices, analyzing actual behavior to estimate the value of ecosystem benefits and helping assess costs and benefits associated with pollution, noise, aesthetics, and proximity to recreational sites [(Costanza et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.3410/B3-14) [(Koundouri et al._1, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s42055-023-00068-1). **Travel Cost Method** - Uses information about how much people implicitly or explicitly pay to visit locations with specific environmental attributes to infer how much they value changes in those attributes [(Sarvasova et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.2478/cass-2014-0008) - Values recreation ecosystem services based on the resources, money, and time visitors spend visiting recreation sites [(Costanza et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.3410/B3-14) - Grounded on the travel costs that people incur to reach a site where they can enjoy the desired ecosystem service [(Franco et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.17221/13/2021-jfs) - Able to measure direct use of nature, whereas hedonic pricing and stated preference methods measure indirect and non-consumptive values [(Nicolette et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU5052152) **Hedonic Pricing Method** - Uses information about how much people pay for houses or other directly purchased items with specific environmental attributes to infer how much they value changes in those attributes [(Sarvasova et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.2478/cass-2014-0008) - Assumes that the value of ecosystem services can be at least partially captured in the price of a property [(Selivanov et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.17221/96/2021-jfs) - Uses observed price differentials in housing markets to assess the marginal implicit price that local environmental attributes add to housing prices, revealing values people hold for environmental goods when other determinants are controlled for [(Nicolette et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU5052152) - Used to define the economic value of ecosystem services that directly influence real estate market prices [(Franco et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.17221/13/2021-jfs) **Production-Oriented Valuation** - Looks at changes in direct-use values from products actually extracted from the environment, such as fish trawled from the sea [(Costanza et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.3410/B3-14) - May also be applicable to indirect-use values, such as the benefits forests provide to agricultural production by controlling soil erosion [(Costanza et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.3410/B3-14) **Other Revealed Preference Applications** - **Avoided cost method**: Based on the cost necessary to avoid possible damage deriving from the loss of a service [(Franco et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.17221/13/2021-jfs) - **Opportunity cost method**: Uses the value of alternative environmental goods for ecosystem valuation, assessing the value relinquished to protect, enhance or create an environmental asset [(Sarvasova et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.2478/cass-2014-0008) Revealed preference methods are particularly effective for measuring ecosystem services that people actually use and interact with through market-related behavior, providing objective measures based on observed transactions and choices [(Selivanov et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.17221/96/2021-jfs) [(D'Amato et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2021.107143) [(Bateman et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.1007/S10640-010-9418-X).

## Stated Preference Methods

**Summary:** Stated preference methods use surveys and hypothetical scenarios to elicit individuals' willingness to pay for ecosystem services that lack market prices. The main approaches are contingent valuation, which estimates total values for environmental changes, and choice experiments, which assess trade-offs between multiple attributes of ecosystem services. (12 sources)

Stated preference methods value ecosystems using questionnaire methods and their evaluation, relying on individuals' responses to hypothetical scenarios involving ecosystem services [(Sarvasova et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.2478/cass-2014-0008) [(Costanza et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.3410/B3-14). These methods use hypothetical scenarios involving ecosystem services to elicit individuals' responses to ecosystem service improvements and observe their behavior of interest [(Li et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10010170). Stated preference methods are capable of measuring values that are not observed by the choices people make, using survey instruments and hypothetical situations to assess non-use values such as preservation and conservation, bequest values, and intrinsic value of open space and species [(Nicolette et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU5052152). **Contingent Valuation Method (CVM)** - Adopts a survey-style approach that constructs hypothetical markets via a questionnaire, where participants' responses reveal their willingness to pay for a particular environmental change [(Sarvasova et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.2478/cass-2014-0008) - Uses the concept of "willingness to pay" or "willingness to accept" and asks individuals how much they would be willing to pay in a hypothetical market to preserve ecosystem services to avoid changes to the related ecosystem [(Burch et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12030819) - Can provide the value of total environmental changes and is one of the more frequently-used methods in ecosystem services valuation [(Petcharat et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12187637) - Uses a highly structured survey methodology that asks respondents to value ecosystem improvements and the ecosystem services they will generate [(Costanza et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.3410/B3-14) - Consists of a sample survey of the reference population that hypothesizes development scenarios for a given ecosystem service, allowing revelation of willingness to pay or willingness to accept compensation for the loss of the service [(Franco et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.17221/13/2021-jfs) **Choice Experiments/Choice Modeling** - A survey-style approach that focuses on the individual attributes of a particular ecosystem, where participants are presented with combinations of attributes and asked to decide upon their preferred combination or rank the alternative combinations [(Sarvasova et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.2478/cass-2014-0008) - Each combination of attributes has a price associated with it, therefore respondents reveal their willingness to pay or willingness to accept each attribute, and this method is able to ascertain all elements of the total economic value [(Sarvasova et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.2478/cass-2014-0008) - Capable of valuating multidimensional environmental changes and allows for the estimation of the relative importance of multiple environmental attributes and their levels [(Petcharat et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12187637) - Dominantly used for the valuation of environmental goods without market price, where the value of environmental change is determined by changes in its attributes [(Tienhaara et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/26395916.2021.1890641) [(Guijarro et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17072386) - Present respondents with scenarios that embody combinations of ecosystem services and monetary costs and ask for the most preferred scenarios to infer ecosystem service values [(Costanza et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.3410/B3-14) - Has largely superseded the use of contingent valuation to value a broad range of ecosystem services, representing the most dramatic development in valuation methods [(Brander et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2024.101606) **Method Advantages and Applications** - Stated preference methods are particularly effective when there is no explicit criterion or reference to measure the passive use and non-use value of ecosystem services [(Li et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10010170) - The major advantage of stated preference approaches is the flexibility to capture both use and non-use values [(Petcharat et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12187637) - Allow for monetary evaluation of ecosystem services that are not exchanged in markets, and they can estimate both their use and non-use values [(Notaro et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-023-01839-4) - Among the most widely used valuation methodologies, with contingent valuation being prominent among stated preference techniques [(Franco et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.17221/13/2021-jfs) - Applied across various ecosystem service categories, with contingent valuation and shadow price methods used for provisioning, regulating, support, and cultural services [(Agaton et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/earth4010006)

## Cost-Based Valuation Methods

**Summary:** Cost-based valuation methods estimate ecosystem service values by calculating the costs of replacing lost services, avoiding damages, or restoring degraded ecosystems. These approaches include replacement cost, avoided cost, restoration cost, and opportunity cost methods that use expenditure-based proxies when market prices are unavailable. (9 sources)

Cost-based valuation methods estimate values based on the costs of avoiding damages due to lost services, the cost of replacing environmental assets, or the cost of providing substitute goods [(Heckwolf et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142565). These monetary approaches are usually based on values of actual or potential expenditure, such as expenses in support of more sustained provision of ecosystem services [(Nijnik et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3897/ONEECO.2.E14808). Cost-based approaches are particularly effective for regulating services, which are often estimated by the avoided cost and replacement cost methods [(Konyushkov, 2015)](https://doi.org/10.19047/0136-1694-2015-80-26-49). **Replacement Cost Method** - Estimates the costs incurred by replacing ecosystem services with artificial technologies [(Sarvasova et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.2478/cass-2014-0008) - Used when ecosystem services need to be substituted through artificial means [(Kermagoret et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0205935) - Applied across multiple service categories, with replacement cost representing 5% of valuation methods in recent literature [(Brander et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2024.101606) **Avoided Cost Method** - Based on the cost necessary to avoid possible damage deriving from the loss of a service [(Franco et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.17221/13/2021-jfs) - Uses preventive expenditures that would be necessary if ecosystem services didn't exist [(Nijnik et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3897/ONEECO.2.E14808) - Represents 8% of valuation methods employed in ecosystem service studies [(Brander et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2024.101606) **Restoration and Mitigation Cost Methods** - Refers to the cost of mitigating effects caused by loss of ecosystem services or restoring those services [(Sarvasova et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.2478/cass-2014-0008) - Includes restoration costs as a less extensively used but established valuation approach [(Brander et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2024.101606) **Relocation Cost Method** - Uses the costs of relocating threatened communities as a proxy for ecosystem service values [(Sarvasova et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.2478/cass-2014-0008) - Represents a type of replacement cost technique applied in specific contexts [(Nijnik et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3897/ONEECO.2.E14808) **Shadow Engineering and Human Capital Methods** - Shadow engineering method provides cost-based estimates for ecosystem service replacement [(Li et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16081474) - Human capital method uses cost-based approaches to value ecosystem services affecting human welfare [(Li et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16081474) Cost-based methods are applied across various ecosystem service categories, with avoided cost, replacement cost, and restoration methods being utilized for provisioning, regulating, support, and cultural services [(Agaton et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/earth4010006). These approaches are part of the broader cost-based valuation framework that includes cost-effectiveness analysis and defensive expenditure methods [(Brander et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2024.101606).

## Benefit Transfer Methods

**Summary:** Benefit transfer methods estimate ecosystem service values by adapting existing valuation results from similar locations or contexts to new study sites, providing a cost-effective alternative when primary data collection is unavailable. This approach uses unit values per area or adjusts transferred values based on site characteristics and economic conditions. (13 sources)

Benefit transfer represents a widely adopted valuation approach that uses existing valuation study results to assess ecosystem services at new locations with similar characteristics [(Sarvasova et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.2478/cass-2014-0008) [(Pandeya et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.ECOSER.2016.10.015). The method is classified as a secondary valuation approach that applies existing ecosystem service value information or data from one area to a new region that has little or no primary data [(Msofe et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/f11010109). Benefit transfer has become more widely used due to scarcity of primary data and limited financial resources compared to conducting original valuation studies [(Msofe et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/f11010109). The benefit transfer approach makes extensive use of results obtained with different evaluation methods applied at a specific place and time, transferring them to environmental goods and services of different locations and timeframes [(Franco et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.17221/13/2021-jfs). The method involves adaptation and generalization of information from existing research to different settings, serving as a useful tool that informs decision-making and justifies allocation of limited resources between competing uses [(Matthews et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.22617/tim220215-2). Among the four major ecosystem service valuation approaches found in literature, the benefits transfer method is considered an easy to apply approach that uses a given valuation study to assess a new location of similar characteristics [(Najmuddin et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land11111906). **Implementation Approaches** Unit value transfer represents the most common application, using values for ecosystem services obtained in different locations expressed as a value per unit area, combined with information on the quantity of ecosystem service units delivered at the study area [(Marta-Pedroso et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3897/ONEECO.3.E26722). Value transfer methods use economic information captured at one place and time to make inferences about the economic value of environmental goods and services at another place and time, with different approaches varying in level of detail and information adjustments made [(Marta-Pedroso et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3897/ONEECO.3.E26722). More sophisticated approaches use meta-analysis to produce value functions that include spatial variables on ecosystem size and abundance, GDP per capita, and population to enable adjustment of transferred values for variation in important spatial variables [(Vackar et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3897/ONEECO.3.E25508) [(Brander et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1007/S10640-011-9535-1). **Application Scope** Benefit transfer methods are applied across multiple ecosystem service categories, including provisioning, regulating, support, and cultural services [(Agaton et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/earth4010006). The method has been extensively applied in ecosystem service valuation studies alongside other approaches such as contingent valuation and hedonic pricing [(Sacchelli, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3832/IFOR2416-010). Comprehensive watershed valuations have employed benefit transfer by supplementing locally available data with transferred values to assess multiple ecosystem service categories [(Batker et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w16152121). Benefit transfer is particularly valuable when data from actual markets doesn't exist for the study site, allowing ecosystem service valuation by transferring existing service valuation estimates from sites with similar characteristics and contexts [(Kermagoret et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0205935). While economic valuation of ecosystem services is context dependent, monetary values from benefit transfer can assist decision-making by expressing values in common units that people understand and enable comparison of different policy options in terms of human welfare [(Vackar et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3897/ONEECO.3.E25508).

## Application Patterns and Method Selection

**Summary:** Ecosystem service valuation method selection follows systematic patterns based on service type: provisioning services typically use market prices, regulating services employ avoided and replacement cost methods, and cultural services rely on travel cost approaches. Market pricing remains the most common approach overall, while choice modeling has emerged as the dominant stated preference method. (4 sources)

The selection and application of ecosystem service valuation methods follows distinct patterns based on the type of ecosystem service being assessed and the availability of market data. For each group of ecosystem services, specific methods of economic valuation are typically applied, with provisional services mainly assessed according to their market values, regulating services often estimated by avoided cost and replacement cost methods, and cultural services valued by the travel cost method [(Konyushkov, 2015)](https://doi.org/10.19047/0136-1694-2015-80-26-49). This systematic approach to method selection reflects the underlying characteristics of different service types and their relationships to existing markets. Contemporary valuation practice demonstrates clear preferences in method selection, with direct market prices remaining the most frequently used method for estimating ecosystem service values at 28% of applications [(Brander et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2024.101606). This dominance is particularly pronounced for provisioning services such as food and raw materials, and increasingly for climate regulation through market prices for carbon credits [(Brander et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2024.101606). Following market pricing, stated preference methods including contingent valuation (17%) and choice modeling (16%) represent the next most common approaches, followed by damage cost avoided (8%), travel cost (6%), production function (6%), net factor income (5%) and replacement cost (5%) [(Brander et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2024.101606). The methodological landscape has experienced notable evolution, with choice modeling or discrete choice experiments representing the most dramatic development in valuation method application [(Brander et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2024.101606). This stated preference approach has largely superseded the use of contingent valuation to value a broad range of ecosystem services, despite being hardly represented in earlier valuation databases [(Brander et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2024.101606). Conversely, revealed preference methods remain relatively limited in application, with hedonic pricing particularly constrained by onerous data requirements [(Brander et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2024.101606). The practical implementation of valuation studies often employs a two-tier approach distinguishing primary and secondary methods. Primary valuation methods follow different economic approaches involving market prices, travel cost, hedonic method, production approaches, conjoint analysis, opportunity cost and replacement cost, while secondary methods rely on biome or land use proxy-based approaches using benefit transfer [(Msofe et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/f11010109). The benefit transfer approach has become more widely used due to scarcity of primary data and limited financial resources [(Msofe et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/f11010109). The functional value method framework organizes these approaches into three main categories: direct market methods, revealed preference methods, and stated preference methods, with specific evaluation methods including market value, resource rent, production function, substitution engineering, travel cost, and characteristic price methods [(Zhao et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114671). This systematic categorization helps researchers select appropriate methods based on data availability, service characteristics, and study objectives, while recognizing that methods of non-marketable valuation are essentially based on the willingness-to-pay approach [(Konyushkov, 2015)](https://doi.org/10.19047/0136-1694-2015-80-26-49).
