## Introduction and Background

**Summary:** Cover crops are plants grown between main crop seasons that can improve how water moves into and stays in soil. This is especially important in dry Mediterranean and semi-arid areas where water is limited and drought stress is common. (LLM Memory)

Cover crops represent a key agricultural practice for enhancing water management in farming systems, particularly in water-limited environments. These plants are grown during periods when the main cash crops are not in the field, serving multiple functions that directly impact soil-water relationships . The primary water-related benefits of cover crops include improved water infiltration rates, enhanced soil water holding capacity, and better overall water availability for subsequent crops . In Mediterranean and semi-arid regions, where precipitation is often limited and irregular, these water management benefits become critical for maintaining productive agriculture . Cover crops achieve these improvements through multiple pathways: their root systems create channels that allow water to penetrate soil more easily, their organic matter increases the soil's ability to store water, and their influence on soil structure creates more favorable conditions for water movement and retention . This makes cover crops an important tool for building drought resistance and resilience in farming systems that face increasing water stress due to climate variability .

## Mechanisms of Water Infiltration Improvement

**Summary:** Cover crops improve water infiltration through multiple physical mechanisms: their roots create channels and pores in the soil, their residues protect the soil surface from crusting, and their organic matter improves soil structure and aggregation. (10 sources)

Cover crops enhance water infiltration rates through several interconnected physical mechanisms that modify soil structure and surface conditions. The most direct mechanism involves root-created macropores and channels that persist even after cover crop termination, with studies showing that these root channels can triple infiltration rates months after the cover crop has been removed [(Mattila, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1111/sum.12976). Meta-analysis research demonstrates that cover crops increase infiltration rates by an average of 34.8 Â± 7.7%, with some studies reporting improvements ranging from 37-65% depending on the cover crop species used [(Basche et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215702) [(Lawal, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.56369/tsaes.2698) [(Sharma et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.4236/AJPS.2018.99140). The surface protection mechanism is equally important, as cover crops and their residues act as a barrier that reduces the impact energy of raindrops, preventing soil surface crusting and aggregate breakdown that would otherwise impede water entry [(Sharma et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.4236/AJPS.2018.99140) [(Karuku, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.32474/ciacr.2018.02.000148) [(Lazcano et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2020.00068) [(Aljibury et al., 1972)](https://doi.org/10.5344/ajev.1972.23.1.35). This surface mulching effect allows water to infiltrate gradually rather than running off, with studies showing that even small amounts of surface residue (2.2 Mg/ha of wheat straw) can increase final infiltration rates from 2.3 to 5.3 cm/hr [(Ahuchaogu et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5937/poljteh2203042a) [(Karuku, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.32474/ciacr.2018.02.000148). At the structural level, cover crops improve soil aggregation and reduce bulk density through increased organic matter inputs from both above and below-ground biomass, root turnover, and root exudates [(Rath et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-8-59-2022) [(Lazcano et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2020.00068). These improvements in soil structure enhance both macroporosity and pore connectivity, particularly in fine-textured soils, leading to increased saturated hydraulic conductivity over longer timescales [(Rath et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-8-59-2022) [(Blanchy et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-9-1-2023). Conservation tillage systems combined with cover crops show particularly strong synergistic effects, with no-till and reduced tillage systems favoring better infiltration rates by 29-41% compared to conventional tillage when used with cover crops [(Lawal, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.56369/tsaes.2698).

## Water Holding Capacity and Storage Effects

**Summary:** Cover crops increase soil's ability to hold water by adding organic matter and improving soil structure, with studies showing 10-22% improvements in water retention. This enhanced water storage capacity helps maintain soil moisture during dry periods and provides more water available for crops. (16 sources)

Cover crops significantly enhance soil water holding capacity through multiple mechanisms centered on organic matter addition and structural improvements. Research demonstrates that cover crops can increase water retention at field capacity by 10-11% and plant available water by 21-22%, with some studies reporting even higher improvements [(Sharma et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.4236/AJPS.2018.99140) [(Imoro et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2021.691603) [(Scavo et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-022-00825-0) [(Sprunger et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erad045). Long-term studies show particularly strong effects, with 13 years of rye cover crops in Iowa increasing soil water storage by 21-22% in the upper 30 cm of soil [(Hovis et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13169309). The primary mechanism driving these improvements is the addition of soil organic matter from both above-ground biomass and root decomposition [(Demir, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.18393/ejss.726906) [(Zhang et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286748) [(Kaspar et al., 2001)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00224561.2001.12457370) [(Barthes et al., 2006)](https://doi.org/10.1201/9780203491935-12). There is a direct linear relationship between soil carbon content and water held at field capacity, with organic matter increasing water retention much more at field capacity than at permanent wilting point [(Scavo et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-022-00825-0) [(Hudson, 1994)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00224561.1994.12456850). Recent controlled studies confirm these effects, showing that after just 2 years, cover crops can increase volumetric water content by 23-28% across different soil water pressures while reducing bulk density by 17% [(Haruna et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.31545/intagr/162799). Cover crops also improve the balance between water storage and drainage by optimizing pore size distribution. While they enhance both macro- and microporosity, the increased proportion of capillary pores (micropores) is particularly important for water availability during dry conditions [(Haruna et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.31545/intagr/162799) [(Amer, 2012)](https://doi.org/10.4067/S0718-95162012000100009). Long-term studies show that these improvements in pore structure lead to better water conductivity and enhanced water storage capacity at the plot scale, with benefits often most pronounced in deeper soil layers (40-80 cm depth) [(Araya et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5194/SOIL-2021-41) [(Gabriel et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.5194/HESS-2017-643) [(Araya et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-8-177-2022). The water storage benefits are particularly evident when precipitation is adequate, with cover crop treatments showing the highest soil water storage after main crop termination in fall [(Krstic et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ATMOS9120492). Additionally, cover crops reduce soil surface evaporation through residue cover, helping conserve moisture from both irrigation and rainfall for subsequent crops [(Sharma et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.4236/AJPS.2018.99140) [(Demir, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.18393/ejss.726906) [(Imoro et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2021.691603). These combined effects make cover crops particularly valuable for enhancing water availability in Mediterranean and semi-arid conditions where water storage capacity directly impacts crop resilience [(Scavo et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-022-00825-0).

## Soil Structure Modifications

**Summary:** Cover crops fundamentally alter soil structure by creating root channels, increasing organic matter, improving soil aggregation, and reducing bulk density. These structural changes create better pore networks that enhance both water infiltration and retention capacity. (13 sources)

Cover crops create comprehensive structural modifications in soil through multiple interconnected pathways that directly impact water dynamics. The most fundamental change involves the formation of root-induced macropores and biopores, where cover crop root systems create vertical channels that persist after crop termination and serve as preferential pathways for water infiltration [(Dinis et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1051/ctv/ctv20223702139) [(Rath et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-8-59-2022). These root channels are complemented by the activity of soil organisms that use existing root pathways to create networks of large biopores, greatly increasing saturated hydraulic conductivity and infiltration capacity [(Blanchy et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-9-1-2023). The structural improvements extend beyond pore creation to fundamental changes in soil aggregation and bulk density. Cover crops enhance soil aggregate stability and size through increased organic matter inputs from both above-ground biomass and root turnover, with root exudates playing a particularly important role in binding soil particles together [(Lazcano et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2020.00068) [(Karuku, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.32474/ciacr.2018.02.000148). Studies show that cover crops can reduce bulk density by up to 17% while simultaneously increasing both macro- and microporosity, creating a more favorable pore size distribution for water movement and storage [(Rath et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-8-59-2022) [(Scholl et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11104-014-2121-x). These structural modifications are particularly pronounced in fine-textured soils, where cover crops increase both macroporosity and pore connectivity, leading to improved infiltration and hydraulic conductivity over longer timescales [(Rath et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-8-59-2022). The improvements create a positive feedback loop where better soil structure enhances the establishment and growth of subsequent cover crops, while the continuous presence of living roots maintains and further develops these structural benefits [(Yousefi et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335106) [(Basche et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215702) [(Basche et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.2136/SSSAJ2017.03.0077). Surface structure protection represents another critical mechanism, as cover crops and their residues prevent soil surface crusting and aggregate breakdown that would otherwise impede water entry and degrade soil structure [(Karuku, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.32474/ciacr.2018.02.000148) [(Choden et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13052726). This surface protection is particularly valuable in Mediterranean and semi-arid conditions where intense rainfall events can cause rapid structural degradation in unprotected soils [(Sabir, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.19080/ARTOAJ.2018.17.556033) [(Martins et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13112674) [(Scavo et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-022-00825-0).

## Performance in Mediterranean and Semi-Arid Conditions

**Summary:** Cover crops perform exceptionally well in Mediterranean and semi-arid regions, with studies showing 22% increases in infiltration and 9% improvements in soil moisture. However, water competition with main crops remains a concern that requires careful management timing. (9 sources)

Cover crops demonstrate particularly strong performance benefits in Mediterranean and semi-arid environments, where water scarcity makes their hydrological improvements especially valuable. Research in Mediterranean vineyards shows that cover crops like Brachypodium distachyon can increase water infiltration by 22% while enhancing soil moisture at 35 cm depth by 9% compared to tillage systems [(Marques et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/proceedings2019030026). These improvements are attributed to the physical barrier effect of cover crops, which increases soil structure stability and organic matter by up to 50% [(Marques et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/proceedings2019030026). The seasonal dynamics of cover crop performance in semi-arid conditions reveal important management considerations. Studies show that while runoff may be higher under cover crops during dry summer conditions (11% vs 1% for tillage), cover crops significantly reduce runoff during wetter autumn periods (3% vs 22% for tillage) and produce higher infiltration rates when soils are moist [(Marques et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1177/1178622120948069). This seasonal variation demonstrates that properly managed cover crops can be recommended for soil protection in semi-arid environments when water shortage risks are minimized [(Marques et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1177/1178622120948069). Mediterranean systems show particularly strong responses to cover cropping for sediment retention and runoff reduction, contributing significantly to soil erosion control [(Choden et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13052726). The effectiveness of conservation agriculture practices, including cover crops, is more evident in arid and semi-arid regions, with arable lands in these climates expected to benefit more from increased water infiltration and reduced surface evaporation [(Abdallah et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11091681). However, the primary limitation of cover crops in water-limited regions remains their potential competition for soil water with subsequent cash crops, which is the main reason for limited adoption in semiarid zones of temperate climates [(Scavo et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-022-00825-0). This challenge can be addressed through strategic management, including appropriate termination timing and selection of less water-demanding species like ryegrass, which provides adequate water balance under Mediterranean-like conditions [(Dinis et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1051/ctv/ctv20223702139). Studies in southwestern France demonstrate that when well-managed and terminated on time, cover crops did not decrease water available to following cash crops, despite increasing evapotranspiration by 20 mm/year [(Martin et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-020-00620-9). The long-term benefits of cover crops in these challenging environments are particularly notable, with improvements in water retention capacity mainly observed in deeper soil layers (40-80 cm), which can compensate for surface water competition and enhance hydrologic functions in water-stressed agricultural soils [(Scavo et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-022-00825-0) [(Gabriel et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.5194/HESS-2017-643). Additionally, cover crops maintain higher soil water content during critical drought summer months compared to tillage systems, making them valuable for climate change adaptation in Mediterranean agroecosystems [(Martins et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13112674).

## Drought Resistance and Resilience

**Summary:** Cover crops build drought resistance by improving soil's ability to store and retain water during dry periods, with benefits becoming stronger over several years. While water competition remains a concern in very dry regions, the long-term soil improvements help crops access water from deeper layers and maintain higher moisture levels during drought. (11 sources)

Cover crops enhance drought resistance and resilience through multiple mechanisms that compound over time to create more water-secure agricultural systems. The drought resilience benefits require several years to fully develop, as improvements in soil properties such as infiltration, structure, and organic matter content from root residues and biomass incorporation lead to better soil conditions for overcoming temperature and precipitation variations [(Krstic et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ATMOS9120492). When precipitation and water supply are adequate during summer months, soil water storage remains highest after main crop termination in fall under cover crop treatments, demonstrating enhanced capacity for water retention during critical periods [(Krstic et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ATMOS9120492). The physical mechanisms underlying drought resilience center on structural improvements that enhance both water infiltration and storage capacity. Cover crops lead to significant improvements in soil hydrological properties, with practices promoting continuous roots and ground cover being most effective at increasing infiltration rates by 34.8 Â± 7.7% to 59.2 Â± 20.9% [(Basche et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215702). These improvements in available water holding capacity and enhanced water entry create resilience to droughts, floods, and extreme weather conditions [(Basche et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215702) [(Basche et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.2136/SSSAJ2017.03.0077). Long-term studies reveal particularly important benefits for water-stressed systems, with cover crop effects on water retention capacity mainly observed in deeper soil layers (40-80 cm depth) [(Scavo et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-022-00825-0) [(Gabriel et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.5194/HESS-2017-643). This deep-layer water storage improvement can compensate for surface water competition between cover crops and cash crops, enhancing hydrologic functions in water-stressed agricultural soils [(Gabriel et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.5194/HESS-2017-643). The linear relationship between soil carbon and water retention at field capacity means that rye cover crops can increase plant available water by more than 21% compared to bare soil [(Scavo et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-022-00825-0) [(Hudson, 1994)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00224561.1994.12456850). However, drought resilience benefits must be balanced against potential water competition concerns. In semiarid regions with limited precipitation, cover crops may reduce water availability for the next cash crop, which remains the main reason for their limited adoption in these zones [(Blanchy et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-9-1-2023) [(Baumhardt et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU7032936). Strategic management through timely termination can address these concerns, with summer cover cropping enhancing soil water storage during the season while maintaining function and resilience of agroecosystems [(Zhang et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286748) [(Araya et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-8-177-2022). Additionally, cover crops facilitate deeper root system development in subsequent cash crops, allowing extraction of resources from larger soil areas and continued growth even during prolonged drought [(Ghosh et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ismeco/ycae132).

## Water Balance and Trade-offs

**Summary:** Cover crops create complex water trade-offs where they increase evapotranspiration and may compete with cash crops for water, but their long-term benefits in improving soil water storage and infiltration often compensate for this water use. Strategic management timing is crucial for maximizing benefits while minimizing negative impacts. (14 sources)

The implementation of cover crops creates a complex water balance equation with both beneficial and potentially limiting effects that vary by region, season, and management approach. The primary trade-off involves increased water consumption through enhanced evapotranspiration versus improved water infiltration and storage capacity. Studies in southwestern France demonstrate that cover crops increase evapotranspiration by approximately 20 mm/year while decreasing water drainage by 21 mm/year, but when properly managed and terminated on time, they do not decrease water available to following cash crops [(Martin et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-020-00620-9). This balance is particularly favorable in temperate climates where effective rainfall generally exceeds soil available water capacity. Water competition represents the most significant limitation of cover crops, especially in semiarid regions where any soil water use by cover crops may reduce cash crop yields compared to fallow conditions [(Baumhardt et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU7032936) [(Unger et al., 1998)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00224561.1998.12457219). This water competition concern is the main reason for limited cover crop adoption in semiarid zones of temperate climates [(Scavo et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-022-00825-0). However, seasonal dynamics reveal important nuances, with runoff being higher under cover crops during dry summer conditions (11% vs 1% for tillage) but significantly lower during wetter autumn periods (3% vs 22% for tillage) [(Marques et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1177/1178622120948069). The long-term benefits of cover crops can compensate for short-term water competition through structural improvements that enhance the overall water balance. Cover crop effects on water retention capacity are mainly observed in deeper soil layers (40-80 cm depth), which can offset surface water competition and enhance hydrologic functions in water-stressed agricultural soils [(Scavo et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-022-00825-0) [(Gabriel et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.5194/HESS-2017-643). These deeper improvements allow subsequent cash crops to access water from larger soil areas, maintaining productivity even during water stress periods. Strategic management approaches can optimize the water balance benefits while minimizing negative trade-offs. Cover crops that maintain continuous living cover promote stable soil aggregation and reduce bulk density, leading to enhanced infiltration capacity and reduced surface runoff [(Blanchy et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-9-1-2023) [(Bolinder et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11027-020-09916-3) [(McClelland et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2278) [(Winter et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13124). However, the increased transpiration from continuous living cover may reduce soil water contents and decrease groundwater recharge, requiring careful balance between benefits and drawbacks [(Blanchy et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-9-1-2023). Recent research demonstrates that multi-species cover crop systems can optimize water use efficiency by increasing the proportion of capillary pores responsible for water availability during dry conditions, with studies showing 23-28% increases in volumetric water content across different soil water pressures [(Haruna et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.31545/intagr/162799) [(Amer, 2012)](https://doi.org/10.4067/S0718-95162012000100009). This enhanced water availability can limit the need for irrigation in humid environments, helping conserve available water resources while maintaining the infiltration benefits that reduce runoff by 10-98% and increase time to runoff initiation by 10-40 minutes [(Yousefi et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335106) [(Basche et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215702).
