**Research Query:** G.2 What factors enable or prevent transformative change in agricultural systems toward sustainability, particularly regarding governance and policy?

---

## Introduction

**Summary:** Agricultural systems face unique challenges in transforming toward sustainability because food systems are deeply embedded in cultural, economic, and political structures that resist change. Multiple interconnected factors across knowledge, economic, social, and environmental domains create "lock-in" mechanisms that prevent transformation. (4 sources)

Transformative change in agricultural systems toward sustainability represents one of the most complex challenges of our time, as food systems are deeply embedded in cultural, economic, and governance structures that resist fundamental alteration. The transformation process is uniquely challenging because food serves as both a source of physical and cultural sustenance while being commodified through complex systems of private and public economics, institutions, and governance [(Grumbine et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.48130/CAS-2021-0003). This complexity means that fostering change requires more than technical innovation—it involves reshaping how culture and identity influence individual attitudes about food, alongside political decisions that affect policy, institutions, and governance structures [(Grumbine et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.48130/CAS-2021-0003). The global agri-food system is currently locked into an unsustainable path due to multiple interconnected factors including technologies' socially embedded nature, misaligned institutional settings, infrastructural rigidities, incongruous research and innovation priorities, individual attitudes and culture, and broader political economy factors [(Schiller et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2206195120). These challenges are compounded by growing food demand, rising population, deforestation, biodiversity loss, climate change, and natural resource degradation, all of which increase pressure on global food systems to transform into sustainable systems to achieve food security [(Ogutu et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321029). A notable framework for understanding transformation barriers identifies extensive "lock-in" mechanisms that span four key areas: knowledge-based, economic/regulatory, sociocultural, and biophysical constraints, which help explain why siloed solutions to food system reform often prove ineffective [(Oliver et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1017/sus.2018.9). Many of these mechanisms become apparent only once other constraining mechanisms are removed, yet over time they may become increasingly costly or even impossible to reverse [(Oliver et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1017/sus.2018.9). This understanding points to the need for well-coordinated actions on multiple leverage points during windows of opportunity for food system transformation [(Oliver et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1017/sus.2018.9).

## Enabling Factors for Transformative Change

**Summary:** Successful agricultural transformation toward sustainability requires supportive institutions, responsible governance mechanisms, multi-stakeholder collaboration, and coordinated policy frameworks that enable bottom-up innovation while providing technical and economic support to farmers. (21 sources)

Transformative change in agricultural systems is enabled by a constellation of institutional, governance, and policy factors that create supportive environments for sustainable innovation. Social institutions play a fundamental role in creating conditions that enable or impede diversified farming systems, as these institutions—including governance agreements, rural household and community norms, local associations, markets, and agricultural ministries—create the conditions that foster sustainable food systems [(Bacon et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-05226-170441). The effectiveness of these institutions depends on their ability to anchor sustainable practices in supportive frameworks that connect ecological benefits with social benefits over the medium and long term [(Bacon et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-05226-170441). Responsible governance emerges as a critical enabling factor, requiring transparent, accountable, and inclusive governance mechanisms that support producers during transformative change processes [(Barrios et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/26395916.2020.1808705). Equitable access to land and natural resources serves both as a foundation for social justice and a strong incentive for long-term investments necessary to protect soil, biodiversity, and ecosystem services [(Barrios et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/26395916.2020.1808705) [(Anderson et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su11195272) [(Ratner et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.276). These governance mechanisms can simultaneously support niche markets through branding of agroecological produce, thus rewarding agricultural management that enhances regenerative production [(Barrios et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/26395916.2020.1808705) [(Wezel et al., 2009)](https://doi.org/10.1051/agro/2009004). Research has identified six critical domains of transformation that serve as enabling factors: rights and access to nature, knowledge and culture, systems of economic exchange, networks, equity, and discourse [(Anderson et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-61315-0_3). These domains function as interfaces between agroecological innovations and the dominant regime, where transformations in governance and power relationships can gradually enable new, more just food systems to take root [(Anderson et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-61315-0_3). Four key entry points have been identified that enable transformative pathways: diversity; circular and solidarity economy; co-creation and sharing of knowledge; and responsible governance [(Wezel et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-020-00646-z). Multi-stakeholder collaboration represents another crucial enabling factor, with evidence from Brazil demonstrating how official integration of agroecology into public policy was shaped by interactions between the state, social movements, agricultural producers, and researchers [(Anderson et al._1, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-61315-0_9). This social dialogue built convergence around shared framings and led to comprehensive policy adoption [(Anderson et al._1, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-61315-0_9). Multi-actor collaborations at the territorial scale, such as food policy councils, are particularly enabling factors in agroecological transformations [(Anderson et al._1, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-61315-0_9) [(Lamine et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11051284). The shift from traditional top-down governance to inclusive and integrative approaches is essential for enabling transformation [(Vicente-Vicente et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12040522). Active stakeholder participation strengthens links between governmental and non-governmental institutions, facilitating social learning processes and promoting collective action toward sustainability [(Vicente-Vicente et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12040522). This requires harmonized portfolios of complementary policies rather than single interventions, including public procurement strategies, input subsidy reforms, seed exchange legislation, and support for participatory guarantee systems [(Jones et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01163-6) [(Nicholls et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21683565.2018.1499578). Enabling environments also require specific structural supports: stable communities without damaging power inequalities, clarity about future expectations, measurement systems for key components, dynamic change processes supporting adaptation, and government support through policy alongside trust relationships between system actors [(Paul et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1177/00307270231179747). Technological advancements, climate-smart agriculture, and policy coherence represent additional pathways, requiring whole-of-government approaches and international collaboration [(Agarwala et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.35335/laweco.v16i2.53). Context-specific strategies are essential, as enabling environments differ geographically due to socio-political history and regional factors [(Williams et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-024-01480-y) [(Rutting et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01251-7) [(Lamine et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2206231120). This requires coordinated public policies that leverage region-specific transition potentials while enabling complementary innovations in both market-based and community-led networks [(Williams et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-024-01480-y). Strategic planning, policy support, and government incentives prove crucial for facilitating sustainable technology adoption, with effective policy frameworks being essential for overcoming barriers [(Pavesi et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.24294/jipd.v8i12.9051). Finally, farmer adoption of sustainable practices requires significant effort supported by governments, public-private partnerships, capital investments, and incentives such as subsidies, price premiums, and technical support [(Ogutu et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321029) [(Pineiro et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-020-00617-y). Programs linked to short-term economic benefits show higher adoption rates, while long-term motivation stems from perceived benefits for farms, environment, or both, with technical assistance and extension services playing crucial roles [(Ogutu et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321029) [(Pineiro et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-020-00617-y) [(Tuan et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09614524.2021.1937556).

## Barriers and Constraints to Transformation

**Summary:** Agricultural transformation faces systemic barriers including entrenched incumbent models, misaligned policies that favor large-scale commodity production, institutional rigidities, and lock-in mechanisms spanning knowledge, economic, social, and biophysical constraints that create resistance to change. (16 sources)

The transformation of agricultural systems toward sustainability faces significant structural and systemic barriers that create resistance to change across multiple dimensions. Agriculture has progressively established itself as a coherent set of production and sales practices tied to the food industry, creating entrenchment of incumbent models that resist transformation [(Magrini et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-01953-2_5). This entrenchment manifests in practical ways—for example, adopting new pulse crops in rotations to reduce synthetic fertilizer use may be hindered by consumer unfamiliarity with pulses, lack of transformation infrastructure, or unsuitable supply circuits, ultimately leading to low pay for farmers and creating economic disincentives [(Magrini et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-01953-2_5). Policy and regulatory frameworks present substantial barriers to transformation. Federal agricultural programs encourage commodity crops and machine-managed monocultures, while the top-down nature of agricultural extension has limited farmer innovation [(Day et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-021-01041-7). Agricultural policy at present fails to effectively promote diversification or conservation practices, with little federal funding dedicated to conservation-based, agroecological, or regenerative methods that transformation requires [(Day et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-021-01041-7). Farm subsidies tend to favor larger farms and discourage crop diversity by favoring monocultural production of limited commodity crops, while policies that favor commodity crops provide little support for diversified farming systems [(Day et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-021-01041-7) [(Bowman et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-05574-180133). The global agri-food system is locked into an unsustainable path due to multiple interconnected factors including technologies' socially embedded nature, misaligned institutional settings, infrastructural rigidities, incongruous research and innovation priorities, individual attitudes and culture, and broader political economy factors [(Schiller et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2206195120). These create extensive "lock-in" mechanisms spanning knowledge-based, economic/regulatory, sociocultural, and biophysical constraints that help explain why siloed solutions to food system reform prove ineffective [(Oliver et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1017/sus.2018.9). Many of these mechanisms become apparent only once other constraining mechanisms are removed, yet over time they may become increasingly costly or even impossible to reverse [(Oliver et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1017/sus.2018.9). Institutional and governance barriers further complicate transformation efforts. The development of institutional settings by multiple stakeholder groups to enable sustainable agricultural programs may prove even more challenging than implementing the programs themselves, requiring linkages within and between various organizational scales [(Melchior et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13020528). Implementation barriers exist at the level of individual businesses regarding awareness, understanding, and confidence to act, while transitions are often slowed down by established institutions and decision-makers who view the price of food systems transformation as prohibitive due to redistribution of costs and benefits [(Melchior et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13020528) [(Grumbine et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.48130/CAS-2021-0003) [(Weber et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab99fd) [(Xu et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19520-3). Economic and resource constraints create additional barriers to adoption. Persistent barriers such as established practices, sunk costs, regulation, and existing infrastructure continue to hinder transitions to more sustainable technology and practices [(Deviney et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1177/20597991231160280) [(Deviney et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13010015). High costs and limited access to resources hinder widespread adoption of sustainable practices, while factors such as input scarcity, water shortage, low income, and marketing difficulties pose ongoing challenges [(Malau et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.22219/jpbi.v10i1.32587) [(Souissi et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2024.1389007). Systemic barriers also include rigidity traps created by financial incentives, technological innovations, and subsidies associated with short-term optimization that strengthen unsustainable feedbacks between social and ecological entities, locking systems into unsustainable trajectories characterized by control and stability but inability to adapt to changing conditions [(Uden et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10051646). These challenges are compounded by short-term thinking, siloed approaches, power imbalances, and linear mindsets that hinder systems transformation [(Matteis et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2024.0159). Finally, the implementation of sustainability transitions remains uncertain and challenging for farmers due to scarce scientific and empirical knowledge, changing agricultural and institutional contexts, and disruptions to practices, performances, and professional networks that transitions may cause [(Martin et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10062083). Political influence of large agricultural corporations and conventional farm organizations limit possible policy changes toward sustainability, while farmer isolation, outdated agricultural education systems, and extension systems that follow agribusiness-funded research rather than supporting on-farm innovation create additional friction [(Day et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-021-01041-7).

## Role of Governance and Policy

**Summary:** Governance and policy frameworks serve as critical levers for agricultural transformation, requiring shifts from top-down sectoral approaches to inclusive, multi-stakeholder governance that addresses knowledge gaps, aligns policies across scales, and creates enabling environments for sustainable practices. (16 sources)

Governance and policy frameworks play a fundamental role in either enabling or constraining agricultural transformation toward sustainability, with their effectiveness depending on how well they address systemic barriers and create supportive conditions for change. The shift from traditional top-down governance to inclusive and integrative approaches is essential, as active stakeholder participation strengthens links between governmental and non-governmental institutions, facilitating social learning processes and promoting collective action toward sustainability [(Vicente-Vicente et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12040522). Politics is at the center of creating and maintaining current unsustainable food system trajectories and will also be crucial in guiding change processes toward sustainable goals, requiring transformation that is normative, deliberate and goal-oriented while building on a strong driving environment that transforms not just food systems but also their governance [(Bene et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399024). Responsible governance emerges as a critical foundation, requiring transparent, accountable and inclusive governance mechanisms that support producers during transformative change processes [(Barrios et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/26395916.2020.1808705). Multi-stakeholder collaboration proves particularly effective, as demonstrated by Brazil's integration of agroecology into public policy through long-term interactions between the state, social movements, agricultural producers and researchers, which led to comprehensive policy adoption including the National Policy on Agroecology and Organic Production [(Anderson et al._1, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-61315-0_9). Multi-actor collaborations at the territorial scale, such as food policy councils, represent particularly enabling factors in agroecological transformations [(Anderson et al._1, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-61315-0_9) [(Lamine et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11051284). Effective policy frameworks require harmonized portfolios of complementary policies rather than single interventions, including public procurement strategies, input subsidy reforms, seed exchange legislation, and support for participatory guarantee systems [(Jones et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01163-6) [(Nicholls et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21683565.2018.1499578). However, significant policy barriers currently impede transformation, as federal agricultural programs encourage commodity crops and machine-managed monocultures while providing little support for diversified farming systems [(Day et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-021-01041-7). Overcoming these barriers requires rewriting the values embedded in farm policies and addressing the political influence of large agricultural corporations that limit possible policy changes toward sustainability [(Day et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-021-01041-7). Major knowledge gaps in agricultural research and policy must be addressed to develop adequate governance frameworks, including quantification of ecosystem service values, costs of resource conservation, true costs of different agricultural types across environmental and social dimensions, and adaptations needed to make alternative farming strategies globally feasible [(Andres et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2016.00005). Policymakers play a key role in supporting adaptation to climate change by setting visions that underlie legal and institutional frameworks, with evidence showing that policies need fundamental shifts to support genuinely inclusive and sustainable adaptation pathways that address root causes of vulnerability through transformative strategies with holistic, intersectoral approaches [(Silici et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-78853-7_13). The evolution of governance systems depends on diverse economic, political, institutional, behavioral, technological, and natural factors, with the choice of governance forms influenced by personal characteristics of participants, scientific and technological advancement, market and social demand for sustainable practices, and public policies including international agreements [(Bashev, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.15406/APAR.2018.08.00293) [(Bashev, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.22606/JAEF.2016.11001). Policy interventions must address socio-economic factors that influence farmers' decisions, including access to markets, credit, and education, while strengthening rural infrastructure and fostering community-based resource management [(Namozov et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202454103003). The governance of agricultural sustainability requires attention to climate change resilience, transformative policies, public engagement, and biodiversity conservation, with policymakers and researchers needing to consider interdisciplinary approaches that acknowledge the interconnectedness of social, economic, and environmental dimensions [(Hanafi et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.58812/wsis.v1i10.274). Different political ideologies and paradigms either inhibit or drive social change movements, creating tensions between local versus global food system approaches that require resilience thinking to inform viable governance solutions at multiple scales [(Kraak et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su16041469) [(Alrobaish et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.15552).

## Multi-stakeholder Approaches and Institutional Arrangements

**Summary:** Multi-stakeholder collaborations and supportive institutional arrangements are essential for agricultural transformation, requiring networks that connect diverse actors across scales while creating spaces for collective learning, knowledge co-creation, and adaptive governance that empowers local communities. (10 sources)

Multi-stakeholder approaches and institutional arrangements serve as critical mechanisms for enabling agricultural transformation toward sustainability by creating the collaborative networks and governance structures necessary for systemic change. Social institutions play a fundamental role in creating conditions that can enable or impede diversified farming systems, as institutions including governance agreements, rural household and community norms, local associations, markets, and agricultural ministries create the conditions that foster sustainable food systems [(Bacon et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-05226-170441). Unless diversified farming systems are anchored in supportive institutions and evaluated against an inclusive set of social and environmental criteria, short-term investments could miss valuable opportunities to connect ecological benefits with social benefits in the medium and long terms [(Bacon et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-05226-170441). The effectiveness of multi-stakeholder collaboration is demonstrated by Brazil's integration of agroecology into public policy, which was shaped by long-term interactions between the state, social movements, agricultural producers and researchers [(Anderson et al._1, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-61315-0_9). This social dialogue built convergence within civil society around shared framing of agroecology and led to adoption of the National Policy on Agroecology and Organic Production. Multi-actor collaborations at the territorial scale, such as food policy councils, represent particularly enabling factors in agroecological transformations [(Anderson et al._1, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-61315-0_9) [(Lamine et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11051284). However, developing institutional settings by multiple stakeholder groups to enable sustainable agricultural programs may prove even more challenging than implementing the programs themselves, requiring linkages within and between various organizational scales [(Melchior et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13020528). Better networking and engagement of different actors within coherent institutional frameworks supporting transition proves crucial to foster agroecology [(Melchior et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13020528). Implementation barriers exist at the level of individual businesses regarding awareness, understanding, and confidence to act, while the importance of understanding farmers' value systems that influence transitions must be considered in policy design [(Melchior et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13020528). The agroecological transition involves profound changes in agricultural innovation systems, defined as networks of organizations and individuals with infrastructures and institutions that affect how different agents interact, access, exchange, and use agricultural knowledge [(Castella et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14063550). The performance and diffusion of agroecological innovations depend on favorable socioeconomic and ecological conditions and involve adaptation to local contexts [(Castella et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14063550). This requires configuring, enlarging, and nurturing spaces where actors are empowered to adjust, adapt, and think and act collectively in complexity [(Castella et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14063550). Realizing transformation potential requires scaling up successful models that mobilize industries, governments and communities, integrating local culture, production and conservation goals using local skills, resources and expertise [(Alexandra, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14073952). Institutions play important roles in how food system transformations occur and with what outcomes, particularly regarding inclusion and participation in food systems and whether institutions enable or constrain actors in mitigating transformation risks [(Manlosa et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1080/26395916.2022.2146753). Effective institutional arrangements require specific enabling conditions: stable and coherent communities without damaging power inequalities, clarity about future expectations, systems of measurement for key components, dynamic change processes supporting adaptation, and government support through policy alongside trust relationships between system actors [(Paul et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1177/00307270231179747). Understanding farmers' perceptions and strategies highlights the need to involve multiple actors in co-constructing policies and plans to address food system challenges [(Souissi et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2024.1389007). Systems transformation requires long-term programmatic and investment cycles that leverage agrifood system interconnectedness, while effective transformation needs to value systems leaders who catalyze change processes and enable inclusive governance that empowers diverse voices in decision-making [(Matteis et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2024.0159). However, agrifood systems transformation is hindered by short-term thinking, siloed approaches, power imbalances and linear mindsets [(Matteis et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2024.0159).

## Context-Specific Considerations

**Summary:** Agricultural transformation toward sustainability requires context-specific approaches that account for regional socio-political histories, local ecological conditions, and varying governance capacities, as enabling environments differ geographically and successful innovations must be adapted to local contexts rather than applied universally. (8 sources)

The context-specific nature of agricultural transformation represents a fundamental consideration in designing effective sustainability interventions, as enabling environments differ geographically due to socio-political history and other regional factors, implying that fostering transformation requires context-specific policy and governance strategies [(Williams et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-024-01480-y). This geographical variation necessitates coordinated public policies that leverage region-specific transition potentials and enable complementary innovations in both market-based and community-led networks [(Williams et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-024-01480-y). The performance and diffusion of agroecological innovations involve a dimension of adaptation to local contexts and depend on favorable socioeconomic and ecological conditions [(Castella et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14063550) [(Wezel et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-020-00646-z). The significant gap between the scales of agroecological research and application at plot, farm, and landscape levels versus the scales of decision and policymaking at regional, national, and global levels raises questions regarding the potential for scaling up successful local applications [(Castella et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14063550) [(Wezel et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-020-00646-z). This challenge requires configuring, enlarging, and nurturing spaces in which actors are empowered to adjust and adapt, as well as to think and act collectively in complexity [(Castella et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14063550). The evolution of governance systems depends on diverse economic, political, institutional, behavioral, technological, international, and natural factors [(Bashev, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.15406/APAR.2018.08.00293) [(Bashev, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.22606/JAEF.2016.11001). The choice of governance forms is influenced by personal characteristics of farmers and other participants including preferences, experiences, knowledge, capability, and ideology, alongside scientific and technological advancement that determines the extent of knowledge about sustainable development factors and consequences [(Bashev, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.15406/APAR.2018.08.00293) [(Bashev, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.22606/JAEF.2016.11001). Market and social demand for sustainable exploitation of natural resources, general socio-economic development priorities, and the overall evolution of institutional environments including rules, standards, and support mechanisms further shape governance choices [(Bashev, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.15406/APAR.2018.08.00293) [(Bashev, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.22606/JAEF.2016.11001). The historical development of sustainable agriculture has been shaped by environmental concerns, shifts in global food demand, technological advancements, incorporation of traditional knowledge, and evolution of policy frameworks [(Donmez et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su16083505). This evolution responds to changing environmental and societal needs and reflects the adaptive nature of agricultural practices, with development being shaped by policy evolution and internal and external sustainability discourses [(Donmez et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su16083505). Implementing sustainability transitions remains uncertain and challenging for most farmers, mainly because available scientific and empirical knowledge is scarce and agricultural and institutional contexts are changing [(Martin et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10062083). These changes in contexts, values, motivations, and objectives can stimulate transition but may also disrupt farmers' practices, performances, and professional networks [(Martin et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10062083). Comprehensive analysis of agricultural and institutional contexts and farming systems during transition provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of strategies used to implement sustainability transitions in given contexts [(Martin et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10062083). For smallholder contexts specifically, policymakers play a key role in supporting adaptation to climate change through policies that set visions underlying legal and institutional frameworks [(Silici et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-78853-7_13). High-level public intervention is needed to ensure that autonomous and planned adaptations work consistently toward transformative adaptation patterns, requiring coordination and investments across household, community, and landscape scales [(Silici et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-78853-7_13). Policies need fundamental shifts to support adaptation pathways that are genuinely inclusive and sustainable, addressing root causes of vulnerability through transformative strategies with holistic, intersectoral approaches that go beyond technological interventions at plot and farm levels [(Silici et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-78853-7_13).
