**Research Query:** 3.1 How has the Common Agricultural Policy been implemented in Andalusia, Spain, and what are the adoption rates of environmental measures in olive cultivation?

---

## Introduction/Background

**Summary:** The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is the European Union's main agricultural support system that provides funding and sets rules for farming practices. In Andalusia, Spain's largest olive-producing region, CAP implementation has been particularly important for promoting sustainable farming methods in olive cultivation. (LLM Memory)

The Common Agricultural Policy represents the European Union's most significant agricultural framework, designed to support farmers while promoting sustainable farming practices across member states . Established to ensure food security and rural development, CAP has evolved over decades to include strong environmental components alongside economic support mechanisms . Andalusia, located in southern Spain, serves as a critical case study for CAP implementation due to its status as the world's largest olive oil producing region, containing approximately 1.5 million hectares of olive groves . The region's agricultural landscape is dominated by olive cultivation, making it particularly relevant for examining how EU environmental policies translate into local farming practices . Understanding CAP's implementation in Andalusia provides valuable insights into how supranational agricultural policies can drive environmental change in traditional farming systems, particularly regarding the adoption of sustainable practices in one of Europe's most economically important agricultural sectors .

## CAP Implementation in Andalusia

**Summary:** Spain's entry into the EU in 1986 transformed Andalusian agriculture through CAP subsidies that promoted olive grove expansion and intensification. The policy shifted from production-based support to decoupled payments after 1999, while incorporating environmental measures through rural development programs. (6 sources)

Spain's accession to the European Union in 1986 marked a transformative period for Andalusian agriculture, as CAP subsidies made olive farming significantly more profitable than other agricultural activities and encouraged farmers to expand olive grove areas and increase production [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12114398). This policy support triggered a major expansion and productive intensification of Andalusian olive groves, particularly in the provinces of Jaén, Granada, and Córdoba, where intensive plantation designs were developed to enable mechanized harvesting and irrigation systems were introduced to what had traditionally been dry farming [(Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122310019). The CAP has since promoted Andalusia's specialization in olive oil production and export worldwide, contributing to the region's dominant position in the global market [(Pena-Rodriguez et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land12040747). The policy framework underwent significant changes after 1999, when the protectionist and productivist model ended, leading to the withdrawal of subsidies for new plantations and the progressive conversion of assistance into payments decoupled from production [(Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122310019). Since the 1990s, Andalusia has benefited from substantial European public aid to develop and modernize regional agriculture, with organic farming growth specifically supported through the institutional framework of EU policies managed by autonomous governments [(Jimenez-Diaz et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13063570). The current Rural Development Programme for Andalusia (2014-2020) includes specific actions for the olive sector through a dedicated olive grove sub-programme, implementing environmental measures such as organic agriculture support (M11) that focuses on promoting environmentally friendly production systems and facilitating transitions from conventional to organic farming [(Rivero et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13102630). However, the implementation has also created challenges, as EU subsidy policies often lack clear criteria and have led many conventional producers to rely on CAP payments for profitability rather than focusing on production efficiency, while the shift toward intensive production has contributed to social issues like rural depopulation and ecological concerns regarding water usage [(Sapena et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.58567/jie01040004).

## Environmental Measures and Policies

**Summary:** CAP environmental measures in Andalusia include cross-compliance requirements, agri-environmental schemes, and Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAEC) standards that mandate specific practices like cover crops, contour plowing, and maintaining vegetation cover. Recent reforms have shifted from production-based support to linking 30% of payments to environmentally-friendly farming practices. (6 sources)

The CAP's environmental framework in Andalusia operates through multiple legislative mechanisms that establish mandatory conservation practices for olive farmers. Spanish legislation requires farmers participating in Rural Development Programmes to comply with Good Farming Practices, including obligations for permanent crops like olives to plow following contour lines, establish crop rotations, and follow area-specific recommendations based on soil type, climate, and slopes [(Leyva et al., 2007)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2007053-246). More stringent requirements apply to farmers participating in agri-environmental soil erosion schemes, which mandate additional measures such as maintaining natural vegetation on parcel borders, preserving stonewalls and terraces, restricting plowing types, and maintaining 50% vegetation cover in row lines for slopes exceeding 8% [(Leyva et al., 2007)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2007053-246). The implementation of cross-compliance standards through European Council Regulation 1782/2003 and Spain's Royal Decree 2352/2004 has significantly increased adoption of soil conservation measures over the past 15 years, particularly non-tillage practices [(Leyva et al., 2007)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2007053-246) [(Santilli et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2011.6.S1.E15). The cross-compliance system replaced previous production-linked payments with a Single Payment Scheme that requires farmers to meet environmental and animal welfare standards while maintaining land in good agricultural and environmental conditions [(Santilli et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2011.6.S1.E15). For olive groves specifically, the Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAEC) standard 4.3 addresses the maintenance of olive groves in good vegetative conditions to prevent abandonment in marginal areas [(Santilli et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2011.6.S1.E15). Recent CAP reforms have prioritized sustainable natural resource management, with cover crops being promoted as one of the most effective measures for reducing soil erosion through subsidies and cross-compliance requirements [(Carpio et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY10091412). The current policy framework includes Ecological Focus Areas (EFA) requirements and specific cover crop management protocols, with farmers required to maintain cover crops for periods spanning at least from October to mid-March annually [(Villanueva et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2015134-7376). The Andalusia Rural Development Programme for 2014-2020 features specialized agri-environmental and climate measures, including an "ecological approach to the mountain olive grove" initiative [(Fernandez-Habas et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.30682/NM1802D). Most significantly, recent high-level CAP reforms have established that 30% of direct agricultural payments must be linked to environmentally-friendly farming practices, representing a major shift toward environmental conditionality in agricultural support [(Maranon-Jimenez et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2022.126597).

## Adoption Rates of Environmental Measures in Olive Cultivation

**Summary:** Adoption rates of environmental measures in Andalusian olive cultivation show mixed progress, with groundcovers now covering 42% of olive orchards and organic farming representing over 5% of total production area. However, overall adoption remains limited, with organic production still under 2% of total olive oil output. (8 sources)

The adoption of environmental measures in Andalusian olive cultivation has shown significant growth in specific practices, though overall rates remain modest. Groundcover establishment has experienced notable expansion, with a more than 23% increase over seven years, resulting in 42% of olive orchards now implementing this soil management practice [(Trivino-Tarradas et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12031090). This growth has been driven by agri-environmental schemes from EU agricultural policies, though implementing groundcovers in permanent crops is still not an extended practice in Spain despite their environmental benefits [(Trivino-Tarradas et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12031090) [(Gonzalez-Sanchez et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3934/AGRFOOD.2016.4.387). The maintenance of plant cover between olive grove lanes until the beginning of spring represents a soil management alternative that is gradually being adopted by olive growers [(Torres et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2012103-562-11). Organic olive farming has shown steady growth, with organic olive groves now representing more than 5% of the total production area in Andalusia, covering approximately 55,000-80,000 hectares [(Rivero et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13102630) [(Sousa et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13147983). The percentage of organic olive oil production compared to total oil production has continued to grow since 2011, reaching 17,000 tonnes in the 2019-2020 campaign and rising from just over half a percentage point to almost 2% [(Rivero et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13102630). This expansion is mainly due to changes in the Common Agricultural Policy that encourage adoption of agricultural practices aimed at maximizing crop sustainability rather than production-based subsidies [(Sousa et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13147983) [(Buitenhuis et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1746-692x.12286). However, adoption rates reveal significant room for improvement. Despite policy support, organic production remains under 2% of total olive sector output in Andalusia, representing between 2.40-3.50% of Spain's national olive grove area [(Rivero et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13102630) [(Sousa et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13147983). Additionally, while agroenvironmental measures implemented since the early 2000s have reduced erosion rates, they remain unsustainably high in a large fraction of the olive area in the region [(Gomez et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE4020170). The adoption process has been supported through information dissemination via organizations like the Andalusian Committee for Organic Agriculture, which provides control, certification, and training services to olive growers [(Lopez et al., 2005)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2005031-119).

## Impacts and Outcomes

**Summary:** CAP implementation in Andalusia has produced mixed results, successfully promoting olive specialization and environmental practice adoption but also creating unintended negative consequences for certain livestock systems. The restrictive application of some policies has particularly affected extensive farming operations in mountainous areas. (1 source)

While CAP has successfully promoted environmental measure adoption and olive sector development in Andalusia, the implementation has also generated significant unintended consequences for other agricultural sectors. The way CAP reforms have been implemented in Spain has hindered the redistribution of aid from the First Pillar, negatively affecting extensive livestock systems [(Morales-Jerrett et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12031181). A particularly clear example of these implementation challenges is the restrictive application of the coefficient of admissibility of pastures in Andalusia, which reduces the area that is actually eligible for CAP aid reception and affects goats more intensely than other ruminants, because they are usually raised in mountain areas [(Morales-Jerrett et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12031181). These outcomes highlight how CAP's focus on promoting olive cultivation and environmental measures, while successful in those specific areas, has created trade-offs that disadvantage traditional extensive livestock systems that are important for maintaining rural populations in marginal areas. The policy implementation demonstrates the complexity of achieving balanced agricultural development across different farming systems within a single region, particularly when mountainous and marginal areas face different eligibility criteria and support mechanisms than intensive olive cultivation areas.
