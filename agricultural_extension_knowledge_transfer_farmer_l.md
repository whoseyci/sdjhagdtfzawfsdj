## Background and Foundations of Agricultural Extension

**Summary:** Agricultural extension serves as a crucial bridge between research institutions and farmers, facilitating knowledge transfer and technology adoption to improve productivity, sustainability, and livelihoods. Modern extension systems have evolved from top-down approaches to more participatory, farmer-centered models that acknowledge existing knowledge and promote two-way communication. (6 sources)

Agricultural extension represents a fundamental component of agricultural development, broadly defined as the process of developing agricultural knowledge and skills among farmers to increase productivity and achieve desirable changes in farming practices [(Raidimi et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.17159/2413-3221/2019/v47n3a520). The primary goal of agricultural extension is to promote interaction and foster synergies within a complete information system that connects agricultural research, education, and information-providing organizations while strengthening producers' ability to implement individual and collective action plans [(Masso et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.5901/AJIS.2016.V5N1P257). Extension services function as more than simple conduits of information - they enhance the efficacy of both farmers and researchers to promote the transfer of agricultural technologies among farming communities [(Masso et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.5901/AJIS.2016.V5N1P257). These systems are primarily responsible for disseminating technological knowledge to farmers and assisting them in upgrading farming practices and enhancing management skills [(Al-Zahrani et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2021.02.009). Extension workers serve as key mediators of information and knowledge, facilitating education and learning processes among farmers, including women and youth in rural areas, while establishing meaningful coordination between research institutions and farming communities [(Al-Zahrani et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2021.02.009). The evolution of agricultural extension has shifted from traditional top-down, technology transfer models toward more inclusive approaches. Modern agricultural knowledge has become increasingly complex, leading to extension systems that incorporate interactive participatory and social learning approaches based on research evidence showing that knowledge exchange and adult learning are most effective when farmers' existing knowledge and experience is acknowledged [(Cliffe et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3991/ijac.v7i3.4002). This understanding has increased focus on experiential learning and farmer-to-farmer exchanges, with recommendations that agricultural training programs be inclusive of all stakeholders and acknowledge the complex framework of social, economic, and environmental factors influencing farmer decision-making [(Cliffe et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3991/ijac.v7i3.4002). Agricultural extension operates within broader knowledge systems that connect local and global sources of information. Farmers operate primarily within localized knowledge systems comprised of diverse sources including family, friends, other farmers, extension agents, community organizations, private input suppliers, and cooperatives, which are based on indigenous experience and knowledge as well as information from larger global knowledge systems [(Abdon et al., 2005)](https://doi.org/10.1626/pps.8.298). The challenge lies in facilitating communication and knowledge flows between these different systems, as farmers need access to information about new technologies, policies, and market information outside their localized systems [(Abdon et al., 2005)](https://doi.org/10.1626/pps.8.298). The scope of extension has expanded beyond simple technology transfer to encompass multiple objectives including helping farmers clarify their goals, assessing opportunities, educating them about decision-making processes, and promoting desirable agricultural development [(Raidimi et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.17159/2413-3221/2019/v47n3a520). Extension services now play crucial roles in climate change adaptation, helping farmers access information and knowledge sources for risk management and decision-making on viable crop and livestock diversification options [(Raidimi et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.17159/2413-3221/2019/v47n3a520) [(Waha et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14158). Additionally, extension systems contribute to poverty reduction and food security by increasing farmer productivity through the application of appropriate knowledge in response to production challenges such as pests, diseases, and changing weather patterns [(Raidimi et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.17159/2413-3221/2019/v47n3a520).

## Knowledge Transfer Mechanisms and Approaches

**Summary:** Agricultural extension employs diverse knowledge transfer mechanisms ranging from traditional top-down approaches to participatory farmer-to-farmer networks, with demonstration farms and trained model farmers proving particularly effective for hands-on learning and technology adoption. (20 sources)

Agricultural knowledge transfer mechanisms have evolved significantly from traditional top-down approaches to embrace more participatory and farmer-centered methods. Modern agricultural extension increasingly incorporates interactive participatory and social learning approaches based on research evidence that knowledge exchange and adult learning are most effective when farmers' existing knowledge and experience is acknowledged [(Cliffe et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3991/ijac.v7i3.4002). This shift has led to increased focus on experiential learning and farmer-to-farmer exchanges, with recommendations that agricultural training programs be inclusive of all stakeholders and acknowledge the complex framework of social, economic, and environmental factors influencing farmer decision-making [(Cliffe et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3991/ijac.v7i3.4002). The process of knowledge transfer from extension workers to farmers requires an enabling environment between the receiver and sender of knowledge, with technology transfer enhancing agricultural productivity through a learning process that progresses from awareness of knowledge needs, to interest, assessment of new knowledge, and finally trying and practicing the acquired knowledge [(Sjakir et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5901/MJSS.2015.V6N4S3P126). Extension services traditionally relied on face-to-face teaching and learning through training, demonstrations, and field visits, though these programs tend to be propagated slowly and are limited in scale and coverage [(kas et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.20546/ijcmas.2020.907.435). Farmer-to-farmer extension models have emerged as effective alternatives, particularly for contexts where crops are underinvested by the private sector and public extension services are poorly funded. These systems use trained lead-farmers to implement farmer-to-farmer extension, with professionals instructing lead-farmers who then train fellow farmers using appropriate methods for low-cost agricultural extension and advisory services [(Okori et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40066-022-00375-4). Research indicates that involving extension agents and model farmers leads to above-average knowledge transfer, though learning from extension agents is significantly more effective than learning from model farmers, suggesting these channels can be used as complements rather than substitutes [(Mesfin et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.57054/ad.v48i1.3039). Formal farmer networks represent a promising collaborative approach to producing and sharing both scientific and farmer knowledge because they privilege farmers' knowledge and learning in the dissemination process. Network leadership may provide technical assistance, navigate cost share opportunities, work with farmers to trial new practices, analyze data from field trials, produce reports, and distribute informational materials that members can access independently [(Asprooth et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-023-10451-5) [(Hoffman et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3733/CA.E.V069N02P113). Demonstration farms have proven particularly effective for knowledge transfer, with studies showing demonstration farms are very effective for disseminating innovations to farmers by serving as practical learning environments where farmers can observe, participate, and gain first-hand experience with innovative farming techniques and technologies [(Aniagyei et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/23311886.2024.2333431). These farms function as living laboratories, allowing farmers to witness the application of advanced agricultural practices and build confidence to adopt and adapt these practices on their own farms while fostering collaborative community learning environments [(Aniagyei et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/23311886.2024.2333431). Model farmers play a crucial role as change agents through peer contact and knowledge transfer of region- and production-specific knowledge. The effectiveness of model farm approaches combines three important aspects of agricultural knowledge transfer: contact with peers who have similar attitudes and farming styles, roadside farming assessment of skills and management abilities, and contact with spatially close model farmers where local experiential knowledge is highly valuable [(Hinzpeter, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/1389224X.2024.2371291) [(Burton, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/1389224X.2019.1674168) [(Hailemichael et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/1389224x.2020.1757475) [(Rust et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-021-01546-y) [(Poeck et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-09308-220233). Contemporary demonstration-based methods have experienced a resurgence of interest, particularly in Europe, for disseminating research-based and practice-oriented agricultural innovations. This approach goes beyond mere information dissemination by providing measurable outcomes such as farmers acquiring new skills, expansion of improved agricultural lands, and productivity gains through optimized resource use [(Amghani et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-94151-6) [(Burton, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/1389224X.2019.1674168) [(Adamsone-Fiskovica et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/1389224X.2021.1953551) [(Marchand et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/1389224X.2020.1847151) [(Andrianarison, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00220388.2022.2096445). Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) offer new opportunities to reach more people and carry out various functions within extension systems more effectively and efficiently, providing easy access to local or global information and simple channels for two-way communication [(kas et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.20546/ijcmas.2020.907.435). Agricultural knowledge flows through various channels including knowledge sharing, exchange, transfer, and dissemination among stakeholders, with the choice of communication channels influenced by availability and accessibility, ICT infrastructure, affordability of communication tariffs, and ownership of communication tools [(Mtega et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.5772/INTECHOPEN.72731). Extension services bring about changes through education and communication in farmers' attitudes, knowledge, and skills, with the role involving dissemination of information, building farmer capacity through various communication methods, and helping farmers make informed decisions [(Al-Sharafat et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.3844/AJABSSP.2012.194.200) [(Jamilah et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.3844/JSSP.2010.64.73).

## Barriers and Challenges in Extension Systems

**Summary:** Extension systems face significant barriers including inadequate resources and personnel, knowledge gaps between research and practice, poor adaptation to local conditions, and ineffective communication methods that often ignore farmers' existing knowledge and diverse needs. (11 sources)

Agricultural extension systems encounter numerous structural and operational challenges that limit their effectiveness in knowledge transfer and technology adoption. Extension services increasingly face a range of challenges, including relatively small numbers of extension personnel relative to farmer needs and demands, variable levels of experience, training, and communication skills, and lack of operational resources (funds, equipment) due to declining levels of government funding and policy support [(Cliffe et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3991/ijac.v7i3.4002). These resource constraints are particularly problematic in developing countries, where farmers hardly feel the impact of agricultural innovations due to poor access to vital information, largely due to widened gaps in extension to farmer ratios that constrain the delivery of extension messages [(Olabanji et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5455/jbau.5987). Knowledge transfer barriers persist at multiple levels within extension systems. The delivery of agricultural technological skills and research knowledge transferred to emerging farmers and other users is not mostly in a simple and understandable form, with inadequate teaching knowledge of extension practitioners being the leading cause for not successfully instilling teaching perceptions [(Teele et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.17159/2413-3221/2020/v48n2a541). Furthermore, presenting agricultural information to emerging farmers in the form of basic education pedagogy undermines adult education prerequisites during training and farm visits [(Teele et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.17159/2413-3221/2020/v48n2a541). Disconnects between research institutions and field-level extension create significant barriers to effective knowledge dissemination. Sustainable agricultural development requires the support of strong agricultural technology and socio-economic research results, and without this, agricultural development will stagnate, necessitating progressive extension workers to collaborate closely with agricultural research institutes [(Garenba, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.48173/jss.v1i1.3). The presence of substantial numbers of farmers with low knowledge indicates persistent gaps in technology transfer and information dissemination, creating a clear need for targeted extension programs that address identified knowledge gaps [(Kn et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.33545/26180723.2025.v8.i3a.1674). Traditional top-down approaches create fundamental barriers to effective extension by failing to account for local conditions and farmer diversity. Extension of sustainable agricultural practices faces many barriers, often seen in disconnects between support provided by extension and farmer practices, whereby extension provides information and services that may be incompatible with current farming systems [(Nord et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2021.1961416). Linear dissemination of input-oriented solutions and technologies has been a dominant agricultural extension mode that addresses farmers as a homogenous entity, overlooking the diversity of needs and priorities of farmers [(Nord et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2021.1961416). The marginalization of farmer knowledge represents a significant barrier to effective extension systems. Local farmer knowledge, including practices and priorities, has commonly been overlooked in extension knowledge systems, with extension recommendations often not taking into account the varieties, fertilizer or plant spacing used by farmers [(Nord et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2021.1961416). Knowledge transfer approaches focus primarily on transferring deterministic scientific knowledge from government to farmers while farmers' indigenous knowledge receives no attention and remains unexplored beyond farming communities [(Tumwebaze et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14778238.2024.2359419). This top-down knowledge transfer approach reinforces power differentials and emphasizes knowledge produced by governments and researchers over farmers' indigenous knowledge [(Tumwebaze et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14778238.2024.2359419). Access and information design barriers further limit extension effectiveness. Despite the wealth of knowledge in research institutions, universities and government agencies, rural farmers may struggle to access information, which hampers efforts to advance agriculture in most African countries [(Preez et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.17159/2413-3221/2023/v51n3a14650). It is common practice to design extension services without consulting farmers about their needs and preferences, even though farmers not only require relevant and useful information but should also be able to access it in the format of their choice [(Preez et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.17159/2413-3221/2023/v51n3a14650). Weak research-extension-farmer-input linkages exacerbate issues faced by resource-constrained smallholders who have poor access to timely and relevant research-based innovations [(Mapiye et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-024-04210-9). The ineffectiveness of traditional extension approaches is often framed as insufficient knowledge transfer from extension to farmer, with this approach assuming that technology being promoted would be effective if all information and resources were received by the farmer, rather than allowing for adaptation of practices to farmers' local conditions and needs [(Nord et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2021.1961416) [(Sekiya et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1626/pps.18.398). Studies show that the majority of farmers belong to medium levels of overall knowledge gap categories, indicating that traditional extension approaches are less effective in improving farmers' knowledge gaps and disseminating production technologies to the farm level [(Hossain et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3329/brj.v25i1.55183).

## Effectiveness Factors and Determinants

**Summary:** Extension effectiveness depends on personalized approaches that match farmers' diverse needs, with demonstration-based methods and direct farmer-extension agent interactions proving most successful. Key determinants include trust, communication quality, knowledge relevance, and ensuring farmers truly understand both the rationale and implementation of recommended practices. (8 sources)

The effectiveness of agricultural extension services is fundamentally determined by the recognition that there is no "one-size-fits-all" approach, as different farmer needs are affected by their geographical location, social and economic structures [(Maulu et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2021.1886663). Extension programs have undergone many changes throughout the years in response to farmers' changing needs as well as the market they operate in, with their role in testing and disseminating research-based agricultural knowledge and technology to rural people resulting in improvements in the agricultural sector [(Maulu et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2021.1886663). The quality and method of knowledge delivery significantly influences extension effectiveness. Research shows that involving extension agents and model farmers leads to above-average knowledge transfer, however, learning from extension agents is significantly more effective than learning from model farmers, indicating that policy-makers can use the two channels as complements rather than substitutes [(Mesfin et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.57054/ad.v48i1.3039). Trust, effort, and locus of control are important determinants of learning effectiveness in extension systems [(Mesfin et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.57054/ad.v48i1.3039). Demonstration-based approaches have proven particularly effective for knowledge transfer and skill development. Studies indicate that demonstration farms are very effective for disseminating innovations to farmers, with 72.92% effectiveness rates reported for cocoa farmers [(Aniagyei et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/23311886.2024.2333431). These farms function as living laboratories, allowing farmers to witness the application of advanced agricultural practices and build confidence to adopt and adapt these practices on their own farms while fostering collaborative community learning environments [(Aniagyei et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/23311886.2024.2333431). The significance of targeted extension strategies incorporating personalized interactions cannot be overstated. The significant relationship found between farm visits, group meetings, and the adoption of improved agronomic practices underscores the importance of targeted extension strategies that incorporate personalised interactions and group-based learning approaches to effectively promote agricultural innovation and sustainable farming practices [(Agyei et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.46676/ij-fanres.v4i4.189). Communication effectiveness varies significantly between different extension service models. Private extension services receive notably higher scores for communication, indicating that farmers find them more effective in terms of interacting and sharing information, while public extension services are perceived more favourably for knowledge transfer, suggesting they might excel in disseminating practical agricultural knowledge [(Tham-Agyekum et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.55227/ijhess.v3i4.761). The knowledge-to-action relationship represents a critical determinant of extension effectiveness. Research confirms that knowing a particular practice is strongly associated with a high probability of implementing it, emphasizing the fundamental role of knowledge in driving behaviour change and adoption of best practices [(Kabirigi et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/27685241.2023.2287476) [(Kaiser et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3589154). For agricultural extension services, this finding underscores the importance of effective knowledge transfer strategies, with efforts focusing on ensuring that farmers truly understand the rationale behind recommended practices and how to implement them effectively [(Kabirigi et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/27685241.2023.2287476). Agricultural extension allows farmers to become better informed and equipped on techniques and knowledge of sustainable practices, with agricultural training generally focusing on strengthening farmers' knowledge and skills through dialog, experience sharing, advisory support, information awareness raising and monitoring of producers . The successful adoption of innovations depends on factors such as the perceived quality of information, relevance to farmers' needs, and effective communication channels [(Danjumah et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e26753).

## Technology and Innovation in Extension Services

**Summary:** Technology and digital innovations are transforming agricultural extension by enabling personalized, data-driven services that overcome geographical barriers and improve communication efficiency. These tools include AI-powered recommendation systems, digital knowledge repositories, and e-learning platforms that enhance both farmer outcomes and extension worker capabilities. (10 sources)

The integration of technology into agricultural extension services represents a fundamental shift from traditional face-to-face methods toward more scalable and efficient delivery mechanisms. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) offer opportunities to reach more people and to carry out various functions within extension systems more effectively and efficiently, providing easy access to local or global information knowledge and serving as simple channels for two-way communication [(kas et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.20546/ijcmas.2020.907.435). This technological transformation addresses longstanding limitations of traditional extension approaches, which relied on face-to-face teaching and learning through training, demonstrations and field visits, programs that tend to be propagated slowly and are small in scale and limited in coverage [(kas et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.20546/ijcmas.2020.907.435). Digital extension services have demonstrated significant potential for improving agricultural outcomes through personalized information delivery. Technology application has the potential for improving the delivery of agricultural extension programs and disseminating agricultural research to farmers and producers since they can lower communication costs, improve smallholder market access and household welfare [(Xu et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0292877) [(Rajkhowa et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0259319). By leveraging technology, agricultural extension can overcome geographical barriers, reach a wider audience, and provide access to valuable information and resources, leading to improved farming practices, increased productivity, and enhanced agricultural outcomes [(Xu et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0292877). Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have emerged as particularly promising tools for enhancing extension effectiveness. AI technologies have demonstrated their effectiveness in enhancing the efficiency and efficacy of agricultural extension services through the analysis of data collected from various sources, including weather patterns, soil conditions, and crop health, allowing for more informed decision-making by farmers [(Ibrahim, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.59890/ijasr.v1i3.740). Through AI-powered predictive models and recommendation systems, farmers can optimize resource use, increase crop yields, and reduce environmental impact, with AI adoption in agricultural extension fostering sustainable agricultural practices and food security [(Ibrahim, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.59890/ijasr.v1i3.740). The personalized nature of digital extension services represents a key advantage over traditional approaches. AI facilitates real-time communication between extension agents and farmers, enabling a more responsive and tailored approach to addressing specific farming challenges, with this personalized interaction not only enhancing knowledge transfer but also fostering trust between farmers and extension services, a crucial factor for the success of agricultural development programs [(Ibrahim, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.59890/ijasr.v1i3.740). E-learning platforms and digital knowledge repositories have proven effective for both farmer education and extension worker development. The success of e-learning modules in improving farmers' understanding highlights the potential for integrating technology-driven solutions into agricultural extension services, particularly in remote or underserved regions [(Yadav et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.33545/26180723.2024.v7.i3c.460). Knowledge repository management systems help extension workers function in technology transfer, facilitation and advisory roles to farmers, with agricultural extension help desk systems serving as knowledge repositories that can be used to disseminate agricultural technology packages and as communication forums about problems of actual agricultural practices [(Harisno et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.21512/COMTECH.V2I1.2768). Open and Distance Learning (ODL) technologies have enhanced the professional development of extension workers themselves. ODL plays a pivotal role in enhancing the social competence and professional development of agricultural professionals, particularly extension workers, with flexible learning opportunities allowing extension workers to increase their skills and acquire new knowledge without disrupting their professional responsibilities [(Gnanasanjevi et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.14719/pst.7505) [(Rohit et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.56093/ijas.v90i2.98999). Continuous professional development through ODL enhances the ability of extension workers to communicate effectively with farmers, promotes the adoption of innovative practices and fosters collaboration among stakeholders [(Gnanasanjevi et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.14719/pst.7505). The evolution toward technology-enabled extension requires addressing both technical infrastructure and knowledge systems integration. Agricultural knowledge systems consist of organizations, sources of knowledge, methods of communication, and behaviors surrounding agricultural processes, with farmers operating primarily in localized knowledge systems while researchers and development workers operate within global knowledge systems [(Abdon et al., 2005)](https://doi.org/10.1626/pps.8.298). Communication and information flows between these different systems, while problematic, is critical, as farmers need access to information about new technologies, policies and market information outside their own localized system [(Abdon et al., 2005)](https://doi.org/10.1626/pps.8.298). Future development of extension services increasingly depends on digital extension tools, participatory research, and institutional reforms to create enabling environments for sustainable farming practices. Addressing challenges in agricultural extension requires a multi-stakeholder approach, integrating research, government initiatives, and farmer-led networks, with future efforts focusing on digital extension tools, participatory research, and institutional reforms to create an enabling environment for sustainable farming [(Kumar et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.9734/jsrr/2025/v31i32881).

## Sustainable Agriculture Adoption Through Extension

**Summary:** Agricultural extension plays a crucial role in promoting sustainable farming practices by bridging knowledge gaps between research and farmers, though success depends on integrating local farmer knowledge with scientific approaches and moving beyond traditional top-down methods. Extension services facilitate climate adaptation, organic farming adoption, and sustainable intensification through training, demonstration, and participatory approaches that respect farmer diversity and local conditions. (11 sources)

Agricultural extension serves as a critical mechanism for promoting sustainable agricultural practices and climate adaptation strategies. Extension services play a vital role in linking farmers to information and knowledge sources for adaptation to climate change and risk management, helping farmers make decisions on viable livestock and crop diversification options [(Raidimi et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.17159/2413-3221/2019/v47n3a520) [(Waha et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14158). The knowledge transfer role of agricultural extension has gained particular importance in the face of increased climatic variability, weather unpredictability, and rapidly changing environmental conditions [(Raidimi et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.17159/2413-3221/2019/v47n3a520). Extension systems contribute directly to sustainable agricultural development by ensuring that efforts toward increasing productivity remain environmentally sustainable. Agricultural extension can play a role by ensuring that efforts towards increasing productivity are sustainable, with sustainable agricultural production ensuring that current production activities do not compromise production chances in the future, often achieved through agro-ecological practices [(Raidimi et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.17159/2413-3221/2019/v47n3a520). The effectiveness of extension in promoting sustainable practices depends significantly on moving beyond linear, top-down approaches that treat farmers as a homogeneous group. Extension of sustainable agricultural practices faces many barriers, often seen in disconnects between support provided by extension and farmer practices, whereby extension provides information and services that may be incompatible with current farming systems [(Nord et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2021.1961416). Linear dissemination of input-oriented solutions and technologies has been a dominant agricultural extension mode that addresses farmers as a homogenous entity, overlooking the diversity of needs and priorities of farmers [(Nord et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2021.1961416). The integration of local and scientific knowledge represents a fundamental requirement for effective sustainable agriculture extension. Local knowledge plays a vital role in the adoption of new technologies or practices because as the dominant form of knowledge in communities they give learners confidence and provide a context upon which new information can be introduced, with effective use requiring a realistic perspective that recognizes some combination of local and scientific knowledge developed through participatory processes [(Kirt et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5897/jaerd2021.1295). However, local farmer knowledge, including practices and priorities, has commonly been overlooked in extension knowledge systems, with extension recommendations often not taking into account the varieties, fertilizer or plant spacing used by farmers [(Nord et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2021.1961416). Agricultural extension plays a key role in the adoption process for both short-term and long-term sustainable practices, with agricultural extension allowing farmers to become better informed and equipped on techniques and knowledge of these practices . Training and extension are among factors that encourage farmers to adopt sustainable practices like agroforestry, with agricultural training generally focusing on strengthening farmers' knowledge and skills through dialog, experience sharing, advisory support, information awareness raising and monitoring of producers . Extension services play a particularly important role in facilitating organic farming adoption and other sustainable practices. Agricultural extension plays a vital role in disseminating the technology of organic farming, with extension services bridging the knowledge gap between researchers and farmers and facilitating the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices [(Kumar et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.33545/26180723.2023.v6.i2a.190). Extension services provide information about organic farming techniques such as composting, crop rotation, natural pest control, and soil management, while organizing training programs, workshops, demonstrations, and field visits to enhance farmer skills and knowledge [(Kumar et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.33545/26180723.2023.v6.i2a.190). The evolution of extension approaches toward climate-resilient agriculture requires innovative methods that actively engage farmers in learning processes. The traditional top-down approach to agricultural extension, which relied on the transfer of knowledge from extension agents to farmers, is no longer sufficient to address the multifaceted challenges posed by climate change, requiring extension services to adopt innovative methods that not only disseminate information but also actively engage farmers in the learning process [(Chourad et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.33545/26180723.2024.v7.i7sd.1142) [(Anbarasan et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.51470/psa.2022.7.3.05). Demonstration-based methods have experienced renewed interest for promoting sustainable agricultural practices across diverse contexts. Demonstration has long been a crucial method for knowledge transfer and learning in agriculture, with recent resurgence of interest in Europe regarding demonstration-based methods for disseminating research-based and practice-oriented agricultural innovations [(Amghani et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-94151-6) [(Burton, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/1389224X.2019.1674168) [(Adamsone-Fiskovica et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/1389224X.2021.1953551). Demonstration plays a pivotal role in promoting sustainable agricultural practices by facilitating the adoption of environmentally friendly and economically viable production methods, enabling broader dissemination of best practices across other production units [(Amghani et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-94151-6). Future development of sustainable agriculture extension requires addressing systemic challenges through multi-stakeholder approaches and institutional reforms. Challenges such as knowledge gaps, complex certification processes, inadequate market access, and weak policy support hinder widespread adoption, requiring a multi-stakeholder approach integrating research, government initiatives, and farmer-led networks [(Kumar et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.9734/jsrr/2025/v31i32881). Strengthening research-extension-farmer linkages, simplifying certification processes, and fostering climate-smart practices can enhance the impact of extension services, with future efforts focusing on digital extension tools, participatory research, and institutional reforms to create enabling environments for sustainable farming [(Kumar et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.9734/jsrr/2025/v31i32881).

## Knowledge Exchange Models and Systems Evolution

**Summary:** Agricultural knowledge systems are evolving from traditional top-down transfer models toward participatory knowledge exchange approaches that recognize farmers as both producers and users of knowledge. This shift emphasizes peer-to-peer learning, integration of local and scientific knowledge, and multi-directional knowledge flows that blur traditional boundaries between knowledge creators and implementers. (17 sources)

The evolution of agricultural knowledge systems reflects a fundamental shift from linear knowledge transfer models toward more complex, multi-directional knowledge exchange frameworks. Current thinking is moving from a model of knowledge transfer toward a model of knowledge exchange, recognizing that information received from experts follows knowledge transfer processes while information obtained through fellow farmers follows knowledge exchange processes [(Olabanji et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5455/jbau.5987). This transformation acknowledges that knowledge is created at multiple levels within agricultural systems, not solely by traditional research institutions. Traditional agricultural knowledge and information systems (AKIS) conceptualized knowledge as flowing unidirectionally from creators to users, with extension services acting as intermediaries. This conceptual model suggests that knowledge is solely developed in one of these groups and that end users require an interpreter to communicate new information from the producers of knowledge, with extension or advisory services expected to act as the middleman for this exchange [(Kallstrom et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/1389224X.2024.2339806). However, many have criticized this traditional understanding of knowledge transfer, pointing out that the reality is more complex, with knowledge also created at the practitioners' level where formal scientific knowledge and informal farmer knowledge are often complementary, building on each other [(Kallstrom et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/1389224X.2024.2339806). Contemporary knowledge systems demonstrate increasingly blurred boundaries between knowledge production and implementation. In current systems, the lines between knowledge production and implementation can become blurred, for example, where advisory service organizations have their own research units, farmer groups share experiences, and through the more accessible knowledge sources available on social media platforms and accessible information on the internet [(Kallstrom et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/1389224X.2024.2339806) [(Rust et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-021-01546-y). The integration of local and scientific knowledge has emerged as a critical component of effective knowledge exchange systems. Local knowledge plays a vital role in the adoption of new technologies or practices because as the dominant form of knowledge in communities they give learners confidence and provide a context upon which new information can be introduced, with effective use requiring a realistic perspective that recognizes some combination of local and scientific knowledge developed through participatory processes [(Kirt et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5897/jaerd2021.1295). Formal farmer networks represent a significant evolution in knowledge exchange models, offering collaborative approaches that privilege farmer knowledge in dissemination processes. These networks are a promising collaborative way to produce and share both scientific and farmer knowledge because they privilege farmers' knowledge and learning in the process of dissemination, with network leadership providing technical assistance, navigating cost share opportunities, working with farmers to trial new practices, analyzing data from field trials, and distributing informational materials that members can access independently [(Asprooth et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-023-10451-5) [(Hoffman et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3733/CA.E.V069N02P113). The persistent dominance of top-down approaches has created power imbalances that limit effective knowledge exchange. Knowledge transfer approaches focus primarily on transferring deterministic scientific knowledge from government to farmers while farmers' indigenous knowledge receives no attention and remains unexplored beyond farming communities, with this top-down approach reinforcing power differentials and emphasizing knowledge produced by governments and researchers over farmers' indigenous knowledge [(Tumwebaze et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14778238.2024.2359419) [(Tambo et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0220844) [(Thorn et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13002-020-00382-4) [(Imam et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1590/0103-8478CR20200807). Model farmer approaches have evolved as important mechanisms for peer-to-peer knowledge exchange, combining multiple aspects of effective knowledge transfer. Model farmers serve as change agents through peer contact and knowledge transfer of region- and production-specific knowledge, combining contact with peers who have similar attitudes and farming styles, roadside farming assessment of skills and management abilities, and contact with spatially close model farmers where local experiential knowledge is highly valuable [(Hinzpeter, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/1389224X.2024.2371291) [(Burton, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/1389224X.2019.1674168) [(Hailemichael et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/1389224x.2020.1757475) [(Rust et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-021-01546-y) [(Poeck et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-09308-220233). Trust relationships have become central to modern knowledge exchange systems, with farmers increasingly relying on peer networks rather than traditional experts. Farmers placed most trust in other farmers to learn about new soil practices and were less trusting of traditional experts, particularly agricultural researchers from academic and government institutions, who they believed were not empathetic towards farmers' needs, suggesting that some farmers may have had enough of traditional experts, instead relying more on their own peer networks to learn and innovate [(Rust et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-021-01546-y). The complexity of modern knowledge flows reflects the diversity of channels and mechanisms through which agricultural knowledge moves among stakeholders. Agricultural knowledge flows through knowledge sharing, exchange, transfer, and dissemination, with the choice of communication channels influenced by availability and accessibility, ICT infrastructure, affordability of communication tariffs, and ownership of communication tools [(Mtega et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.5772/INTECHOPEN.72731). Future knowledge exchange systems require innovative approaches that actively engage farmers in learning processes while addressing climate change and sustainability challenges. The traditional top-down approach to agricultural extension is no longer sufficient to address the multifaceted challenges posed by climate change, requiring extension services to adopt innovative methods that not only disseminate information but also actively engage farmers in the learning process [(Chourad et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.33545/26180723.2024.v7.i7sd.1142) [(Anbarasan et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.51470/psa.2022.7.3.05).
