**Research Query:** O.2 How does farmer risk perception affect the adoption of cover crops and other conservation practices, particularly in financially marginal farming systems?

---

## Introduction and Background

**Summary:** Farmer risk perception is a key factor that influences whether farmers adopt conservation practices like cover crops, as farmers must weigh potential benefits against financial and operational uncertainties. This decision-making process becomes especially complex in financially marginal farming systems where resources are limited and the consequences of failed investments are more severe. (LLM Memory)

The adoption of conservation practices such as cover crops represents a significant decision point for farmers, involving careful consideration of multiple risk factors alongside potential benefits . Risk perception refers to how farmers subjectively assess and interpret the uncertainties associated with implementing new agricultural practices, which often differs from objective risk assessments . These perceptions are shaped by farmers' individual experiences, financial situations, farm characteristics, and access to information and support systems . In financially marginal farming systems, where profit margins are thin and financial buffers are limited, risk perception becomes an even more critical factor in adoption decisions . Farmers in these systems must carefully balance the long-term environmental and economic benefits of conservation practices against immediate costs and the potential for short-term income disruption . Understanding how risk perception operates in these contexts is essential for developing effective policies and programs that encourage sustainable agricultural practices while addressing farmers' legitimate concerns about financial viability .

## Types of Risks Perceived by Farmers

**Summary:** Farmers perceive multiple types of risks when considering conservation practices like cover crops, including yield reduction concerns, establishment and termination costs, timing and labor constraints, and uncertainty about profitability. These risk perceptions are particularly pronounced when farmers lack experience with unfamiliar practices. (12 sources)

Farmers identify several key categories of risk when evaluating conservation practices, with **yield reduction** being a primary concern that influences adoption decisions across multiple practices including cover crops, conservation tillage, and reduced nitrogen application [(Ranjan et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2019.1648710) [(Roesch-McNally et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1742170517000096). As one farmer explained about cover crops: "I have not tried on soybeans going to corn and probably for obvious reasons... it could be a five bushel decline so that gives me a little bit of concern" [(Ranjan et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2019.1648710) [(Roesch-McNally et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1742170517000096). For some producers, concerns that winter rye cover crops could reduce corn yields represent a major impediment to adoption [(Roesch-McNally et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1742170517000096). **Financial risks** constitute another major category, with farmers concerned about both direct costs and opportunity costs associated with establishing and terminating cover crops [(Ranjan et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2019.1648710) [(Roesch-McNally et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1742170517000096). A notable study found that 74% of farmers reported potential economic impacts had moderate-to-very strong influence on management practice changes, and 57% agreed that pressure to make profit margins makes it difficult to invest in conservation practices [(Plastina et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1742170518000194). These financial concerns are particularly acute given that many farms operate with negative net incomes, with projected median farm income of -$1,558 in some years [(Helling et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE5030879). **Operational and timing risks** also significantly influence farmer decisions. Narrow planting windows and lack of time/labor were identified as the two primary challenges for cover crop adoption [(Adhikari et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1742170523000042). The timing of labor demands creates particular concerns, as delayed operations can lead to production risks if farmers cannot manage cover crops at appropriate growth stages for effective nutrient management and planting [(Silva et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1090690). **Uncertainty and knowledge gaps** represent another risk category, particularly for unfamiliar practices. Since new production methods like mixed cropping are associated with higher risks due to farmers' lack of experience, implementation implies changes in income risk for farmers [(Bonke et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13041631). Risk averse farmers may not adopt conservation agriculture because they are unwilling to take on unfamiliar farming practices or because they do not understand the risk-reducing capabilities of these practices [(Ngoma et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fagro.2021.671690). Lack of knowledge and uncertainty about production outcomes serve as barriers to adoption, though these challenge perceptions regarding reduced yield and lack of time/labor significantly decrease as years of usage increase [(Adhikari et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1742170523000042) [(Silva et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1090690). Interestingly, farmers' perceptions of existing problems can also influence adoption in unexpected ways. Increased perception of soil degradation actually decreases the likelihood of adopting mixed cropping and cover crops, suggesting that farmers may view severely degraded soils as too risky for implementing new practices [(Cechura et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1002/ldr.5318). Conversely, farmers who perceive weather-related risks from climate change are more likely to adopt conservation practices, with concerns about excess water or soil erosion being significant predictors of intentions to increase use of no-till farming, cover crops, and tile drainage [(Roesch-McNally et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-016-9719-y) [(Arbuckle et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0013916513503832) [(Day et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-021-01041-7).

## How Risk Perception Affects Adoption Decisions

**Summary:** Risk perception operates through farmers' individual risk attitudes and tolerance levels, with risk-averse farmers generally less likely to adopt unfamiliar conservation practices even when these practices may reduce long-term risks. However, farmers who perceive specific environmental risks like weather-related threats or soil erosion are more motivated to adopt conservation practices as risk mitigation strategies. (12 sources)

The relationship between risk perception and adoption decisions is fundamentally mediated by farmers' individual **risk attitudes and tolerance levels**. Risk attitude is negatively related to the probability of adopting some conservation practices like compost, whereas it is positively related to the probabilities of adopting agroforestry systems and crop rotation [(Zeweld et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10092963). Generally, farmers exhibit risk aversion in most situations of farm-level decision making, and in many situations, farmers will prefer on-farm environmental sustainability strategies over other risk mitigation strategies [(Nastis et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11051303). **Risk-averse farmers face particular challenges** in adopting conservation practices, even when these practices may ultimately reduce risks. Risk averse farmers may not adopt conservation agriculture because they are unwilling to take on unfamiliar farming practices or because they do not understand the risk-reducing capabilities of these practices, and impatient farmers may not adopt if they believe significant benefits only accrue in the medium to long-term while their primary interests are short term [(Ngoma et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fagro.2021.671690). Similarly, farmers who are risk averse are less likely to intensify conservation efforts, and participation in incentive-based conservation programs increases adoption marginally by 4.1%, while risk averse farmers are still less likely to adopt by 2.2% [(Gong et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40100-021-00201-8). This pattern extends to resource-constrained farmers, where those following unsustainable farming practices demonstrated a low level of self-efficacy and a risk-averse attitude to adopting conservation technologies [(Abebe, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.21601/ejosdr/11822). Paradoxically, **specific risk perceptions can motivate adoption** when farmers view conservation practices as solutions to perceived threats. Farmers' perception about drought and access to weather information are key determinants of adoption of crop choice and soil and water conservation measures [(Issahaku et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8489.12357). Concerns about excess water or risk of soil erosion were significant predictors in all models examining intentions to increase use of no-till farming, cover crops, and tile drainage, with farmers who had higher perceptions of weather-related risk being more likely to increase their use of these practices [(Roesch-McNally et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-016-9719-y) [(Arbuckle et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0013916513503832) [(Arbuckle et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-013-0700-0). **Farm characteristics and support systems** can modify how risk perception influences adoption decisions. Farmers with large farm sizes are more likely to adopt conservation practices such as cover crops and diverse crop rotation as more acres might increase the risk-bearing abilities of farmers, and for producers with pasture acres, integrating cover crops with livestock is a practice with minimal risk [(Kolady et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1017/aae.2020.24). Cost-share programs reduce the profitability risk associated with cover crops and incentivize producers to take the risk of growing cover crops even when there is uncertainty over economic benefits [(Kolady et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1017/aae.2020.24). Interestingly, social influence plays a crucial role, as adoption by neighbors emerged as perhaps the most important factor in shaping adoption decisions, even though it was perceived by only a handful of respondents as having shaped their decisions [(Bell et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W10010051). The **perceived effectiveness and profitability** of conservation practices serve as crucial determinants that can overcome risk-related barriers. Farmers show inclination towards practices such as minimal soil cultivation, mulching, cultivation of crop mixtures, and cover crops when they perceive these methods as effective and profitable [(Cechura et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1002/ldr.5318). However, limited awareness of the profitability and efficiency of conservation practices among farmers can hinder adoption, and increased perception of soil degradation actually decreases the likelihood of adopting mixed cropping and cover crops [(Cechura et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1002/ldr.5318).

## Financial Constraints and Risk in Marginal Farming Systems

**Summary:** Financial constraints significantly amplify risk perceptions in marginal farming systems, where farmers with limited resources and thin profit margins face greater barriers to adopting conservation practices. These farmers often lack the risk-bearing capacity and financial buffers needed to invest in unfamiliar practices, even when long-term benefits may outweigh costs. (10 sources)

Financial constraints create particularly acute challenges in marginal farming systems where many farms operate with **negative net incomes**. The reality is that a majority of farmers have net negative incomes, with the USDA Economic Research Service noting that many farms are not even profitable in the best farm income years, and the projected median farm income is -$1,558 [(Helling et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE5030879). Under these conditions, if farmers do not perceive enough potential harm to their farm systems to warrant adoption, they will be better off financially not implementing a conservation practice regardless of any existing environmental concerns [(Conner et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU8070684). This creates a fundamental tension where environmental benefits may not justify immediate financial risks for struggling operations. **Farm size and resource endowment** directly influence farmers' ability to bear the risks associated with conservation practices. Farmers with large farm sizes are more likely to adopt conservation practices such as cover crops and diverse crop rotation as more acres might increase the risk-bearing abilities of farmers [(Kolady et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1017/aae.2020.24). Conversely, resource-constrained farmers face particularly challenging circumstances. Farmers that follow unsustainable farming practices were endowed with relatively lower pieces of farmland and disadvantaged in possession of other productive assets, and they demonstrated a low level of self-efficacy and a risk-averse attitude to adopting conservation technologies, as they possessed smaller sizes of farmland compared with the village and regional average [(Abebe, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.21601/ejosdr/11822). The pre-decisional processes for adopting conservation technologies among these farmers were jeopardized by their disadvantageous position in possession of productive assets and higher perception of risks since practices like terrace construction and tree planting compete for the small farmland they possess [(Abebe, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.21601/ejosdr/11822). **Economic uncertainty** represents a major barrier even when farmers recognize potential benefits. The uncertainty over economic benefits, which depend on weather, farm characteristics, management practices, cropping systems, and input costs, is one of the reasons for the overall low adoption rates for cover crops [(Kolady et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1017/aae.2020.24). Farmers' perceptions that cover crops are costly was found to be a major barrier to their adoption, with 74% of respondents reporting that potential economic impacts had moderate-to-very strong influence on changes in their management practices, and 57% agreed that pressure to make profit margins makes it difficult to invest in conservation practices [(Plastina et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1742170518000194). Beyond direct costs, farmers identify financial limitations as well as limitations with time and labor as barriers to conservation practice adoption [(Silva et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1090690). The relationship between financial constraints and risk perception creates a situation where **perceived risk threatens farm viability**. If there is a perceived risk that implementing a conservation practice will threaten the viability of a farm, this will typically outweigh the perceived benefits of implementing that practice regardless of environmental awareness and other factors [(Helling et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE5030879). This is particularly relevant given that income specifically from farm operations predicted adoption of cover crops [(Lu et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.116240), suggesting that financial stability is a prerequisite for adoption in many cases. Financial support mechanisms can help overcome these barriers by reducing risk exposure. Cost-share programs reduce the profitability risk associated with cover crops and incentivize producers to take the risk of growing cover crops even when there is uncertainty over economic benefits [(Kolady et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1017/aae.2020.24). Payments are designed to partially compensate farmers for direct costs incurred and provide a risk premium to offset the uncertainty associated with adoption, with farmers requiring a risk premium reflecting income greater than expected revenue from farming [(Conner et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU8070684). Studies show that monetary incentives and support programs were found to be important drivers encouraging adoption of conservation practices, and farmers' perception of government support being available can build farmers' confidence to invest in sustainable agricultural intensification practices despite uncertainty [(Adamsone-Fiskovica et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1742170524000085) [(Lee et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1017/aae.2019.20) [(Luther et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.2489/jswc.2020.00184).

## Strategies to Overcome Risk-Related Barriers

**Summary:** Several strategies can help overcome risk-related barriers to conservation practice adoption, including financial support programs that reduce profitability risks, technical assistance and education to address knowledge gaps, and leveraging social networks and neighbor adoption to normalize new practices. (9 sources)

**Financial incentive programs** represent one of the most effective strategies for reducing risk-related barriers to conservation adoption. Cost-share programs reduce the profitability risk associated with cover crops and incentivize producers to take the risk of growing cover crops even when there is uncertainty over economic benefits [(Kolady et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1017/aae.2020.24). These payments are designed to partially compensate farmers for direct costs incurred and provide a risk premium to offset the uncertainty associated with adoption, with farmers requiring a risk premium reflecting income greater than expected revenue from farming [(Conner et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU8070684). Studies show that monetary incentives and support programs were found to be important drivers encouraging adoption of conservation practices [(Adamsone-Fiskovica et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1742170524000085) [(Lee et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1017/aae.2019.20) [(Luther et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.2489/jswc.2020.00184). **Building farmer confidence through government support** can help overcome uncertainty barriers even when specific financial incentives are not provided. Farmers' perception of government support being available can build farmers' confidence to invest in sustainable agricultural intensification practices despite uncertainty [(Adamsone-Fiskovica et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1742170524000085). This psychological support effect suggests that the mere presence of supportive policies can reduce perceived risks by providing farmers with a sense of institutional backing for their conservation investments. **Technical assistance and education programs** address knowledge gaps that contribute to risk perceptions. Lack of knowledge, uncertainty of production outcomes, and greater perceived risk have been cited as barriers to adoption of conservation practices, and surveys found that if technical assistance were more widely available, more farmers would attempt to use cover crops [(Silva et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1090690). Beyond lack of knowledge, farmers identified the need for specific guidance regarding best management practices for successful implementation as a major barrier [(Silva et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1090690). **Leveraging social networks and neighbor adoption** emerges as a particularly powerful strategy, despite being underrecognized by farmers themselves. Adoption by neighbors emerged as perhaps the most important factor in shaping adoption decisions, even though it was perceived by only a handful of respondents as having shaped their decisions [(Bell et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W10010051). This suggests that programs facilitating peer-to-peer learning and demonstration projects can effectively reduce risk perceptions by normalizing conservation practices within farming communities. **Targeting risk-averse farmers with specific program designs** can help overcome adoption barriers for those most reluctant to try new practices. Awards may be better integrated into conservation programs both to boost adoption of conservation practices and to specifically target those farmers who consider themselves to be risk averse [(Schattman et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1525/ELEMENTA.2021.00120). This approach recognizes that different farmer risk profiles may require tailored intervention strategies. **Emphasizing risk reduction benefits** of conservation practices can help reframe farmer perceptions from viewing these practices as risky investments to seeing them as risk management tools. Farmers who had higher perceptions of weather-related risk were more likely to increase their use of conservation practices, while farmers who had high confidence in their current practices were less likely to adopt new ones [(Roesch-McNally et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-016-9719-y). This suggests that education programs highlighting how conservation practices reduce production and environmental risks could be more effective than focusing solely on potential benefits.
