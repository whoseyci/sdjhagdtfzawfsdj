## Introduction/Background

**Summary:** Agricultural economics faces a complex challenge where farmers make decisions under tight profit margins while being influenced by government subsidies that can create long-term dependency. Traditional economic models assume farmers make perfectly rational choices, but real-world decision-making involves psychological factors and cognitive limitations that affect how agricultural systems operate. (LLM Memory)

Agricultural decision-making sits at the intersection of economic necessity and psychological reality, where farmers must navigate complex trade-offs while operating within systems that often reinforce existing patterns of behavior . The traditional view of economic rationality assumes that farmers make optimal decisions based on complete information and clear cost-benefit analyses, but this perspective fails to capture the full complexity of agricultural economics . In reality, farmers operate under conditions of bounded rationality, where cognitive limitations, time constraints, and incomplete information shape their choices in ways that deviate from theoretical economic models . The challenge becomes particularly acute when government subsidies enter the equation, creating what economists call "lock-in" effects where farmers become dependent on financial support systems that may distort natural market signals . These subsidy programs, while designed to provide stability and support, can inadvertently create cycles of dependency that influence long-term agricultural planning and investment decisions . The situation is further complicated by the inherently small profit margins in many agricultural operations, which amplify the impact of any economic decision and make farmers particularly sensitive to policy changes and market fluctuations .

## Economic Rationality vs. Bounded Rationality in Agricultural Decision-Making

**Summary:** Traditional economic models assume farmers make perfectly rational decisions to maximize profits, but research shows farmers actually use bounded rationality - making decisions with limited information, cognitive constraints, and relying on habits and social influences rather than pure economic optimization. (11 sources)

The divide between theoretical economic models and actual farmer behavior reveals fundamental limitations in how agricultural decision-making has been understood and analyzed. Traditional economic theory treats farmers as rational utility-maximizing agents who make optimal decisions based on complete information and clear cost-benefit calculations [(Lin et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.9734/cjast/2020/v39i3931101). This "economic man" perspective assumes that farmers, like other microeconomic subjects, will rationally analyze market changes and conduct agricultural activities with the goal of maximizing profits [(Lin et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.9734/cjast/2020/v39i3931101). However, systematic research has found a strong orientation toward modeling behavior as rational utility-maximizing processes despite decades of evidence demonstrating the prevalence of simpler heuristic choices when facing uncertainty and real-world constraints [(Waldman et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abb909). In reality, farmers operate under conditions of bounded rationality, where decision-making is limited by the information they have, their cognitive limitations, and the finite time available to make decisions [(Waldman et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abb909) [(Xu et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0322798). This bounded rationality manifests in several key ways: farmers rely on satisficing behavior and fast, frugal heuristics that often outweigh the scarcity of financial and human resources [(Cordaro et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13137483). Rather than conducting exhaustive analysis, farmers make decisions that involve three directions: economic rationality, following established habits, and conforming to social norms or what most people choose [(Liu et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11010136). The cognitive scarcity under which farmers operate creates decision-making patterns that deviate significantly from theoretical models. Farmers develop lock-in behaviors, making long-term purchases of products or repeatedly visiting suppliers without conducting in-depth information collection, characterized by habitual and repetitive actions [(Lin et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.9734/cjast/2020/v39i3931101). These behaviors are influenced not only by individual cognitive capabilities but also by the structure of their social environment and interactions with other farmers [(Cordaro et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13137483). The result is that farmers' decisions are shaped by external environmental factors, policy incentives, personal experience, and self-interest rather than pure economic optimization [(Zhang et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1575121) [(Xu et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0322798). This recognition of bounded rationality has important implications for policy analysis and agricultural modeling. Research demonstrates that considering behavioral factors enriches economic analyses of farmer decision-making and can lead to more realistic and effective agricultural policies [(Huber et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1477-9552.12447) [(Dessart et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ERAE/JBZ019). The complex web of factors influencing farmer behavior includes not just economic constraints and incentives, but also pro-environmental attitudes, social factors, past experience, and diverse non-economic reasons for pursuing various livelihood options [(Bartkowski et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10093179) [(Beban, 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5304/JAFSCD.2014.042.004). Taking into account cognitive biases in farmers' financial decision-making remains an important avenue for future policy research [(Labajova et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1108/afr-09-2020-0140).

## Mental Accounting and Behavioral Economics in Agriculture

**Summary:** Mental accounting theory explains how farmers categorize different types of income and expenses into separate psychological "accounts," which affects their willingness to spend money and respond to subsidies. This cognitive process helps explain why farmers react differently to various policy incentives and why some agricultural programs fail to achieve their intended goals. (6 sources)

Mental accounting, a key concept from behavioral economics, provides crucial insights into how farmers make financial decisions by categorizing their income and expenses into separate psychological accounts [(Zhang et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W8090375). This mental categorization process significantly influences how farmers respond to different types of government support and agricultural policies. Research demonstrates that farmers allocate their various income sources into different mental accounts, and their propensities to consume out of different income sources vary considerably [(Peng et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.22434/IFAMR2018.0011). The practical implications of mental accounting become evident when examining how farmers respond to different types of subsidies and incentives. Studies show that the majority of farmers categorize agricultural inputs into different groups, with approximately 26% utilizing mental budgeting for specific practices like pest control [(Zeng et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1108/caer-08-2020-0191). Importantly, farmers who utilize mental budgeting report a higher willingness to switch to environmentally beneficial practices when offered targeted subsidies rather than general monetary incentives [(Zeng et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1108/caer-08-2020-0191). This psychological framework helps explain why some agricultural policies fail to achieve their intended outcomes. When farmers receive subsidies but do not understand their purpose or value, they may allocate the money into different mental budgeting categories rather than the categories the subsidies are aimed at [(Zeng et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1108/caer-08-2020-0191). For example, private transfer income has been found to have a greater impact on consumption than government transfer income such as agricultural subsidies and disaster relief, even though agricultural subsidies have high marginal propensities to consume because farmers classify these as current disposable income [(Peng et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.22434/IFAMR2018.0011). The behavioral economics approach also reveals how previous policies can create negative psychological externalities through mental accounting processes. Research shows that governmental policies can influence farmers' psychological dependence on the government, which then negatively affects their subsequent decision-making regarding resource management and conservation [(Zhang et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W8090375). This understanding is particularly relevant for addressing complex agricultural challenges, where behavioral factors like hyperbolic discounting and framing effects help explain why farmers may want to adopt certain practices but fail to translate their intentions into actions [(Muramatsu et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1590/0101-31572017V37N02A06). Future research in this area continues to explore models of behavior under risk, behavioral time discounting, and social preferences, recognizing that context-dependent experimentation is needed to develop effective agricultural policies that account for the unique decision-making patterns of farmers [(Mesa-Vazquez et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su131810244) [(Li et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44264-025-00078-w).

## Subsidy Dependence and Lock-in Effects

**Summary:** Government subsidies create dependency cycles where farmers become "locked" into existing production systems and cannot easily adapt to market changes. These lock-in effects occur through economic traps, adaptive preferences, and technological dependencies that ultimately reduce farmer autonomy and market responsiveness. (6 sources)

Agricultural subsidies create powerful lock-in effects that fundamentally alter how farmers operate and make decisions, often trapping them in cycles of dependency that persist long after the original policy rationale has changed. The most direct form of this occurs through what researchers call the "high-profit trap," where capital becomes completely immobile and is "locked" into agriculture when expected revenue falls below acquisition costs but remains higher than resale value [(Czyzewski et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11030791). This economic mechanism creates a situation where farmers cannot easily exit or adapt their operations, even when market conditions suggest they should. The dependency effects extend beyond simple economic calculations to reshape farmer psychology and decision-making processes. Subsidies and their underlying narratives can alter farmers' own perceptions and work practices over time, creating what economists call "adaptive preferences" that shape themselves to and positively reinforce available options [(Brown et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.105136). This psychological adaptation means that decades of production-oriented payments have imposed a productivist ethos on farmers, making it difficult for them to consider alternative approaches even when economically rational. Research demonstrates that agricultural businesses often cannot support themselves without subsidy programs, with 72% of farmers considering subsidies an important factor in protecting their businesses [(Mazancova et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1177/21582440251324756). For small businesses, subsidies can constitute up to four times their assets, creating extreme dependency where farms would disappear without continued government support [(Mazancova et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1177/21582440251324756). While these subsidies help reduce income variability and make farmers' incomes more stable, they also create economic dependence that limits adaptive capacity. The lock-in effects are further reinforced by technological dependencies, where many innovations are characterized by legal or technological constraints built into products by technology and service providers that prevent farmers from freely choosing alternative equipment according to their needs [(Hackfort et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/15487733.2024.2375808). These technological lock-ins reinforce existing power relations and farmers' dependence on corporate technologies and services, ultimately strengthening dependence on the agro-industrial farming model [(Hackfort et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/15487733.2024.2375808). The policy challenge is complicated by the fact that government subsidies must be implemented within appropriate ranges - subsidies that are too low may fail to bring positive benefits to agriculture, while excessive subsidies may affect production motivation and hinder economic development [(Wu et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0311490). Despite these challenges, decoupled payments reduce the market's influence on farmers' incomes, creating a buffer that can prevent necessary market adaptations [(Czyzewski et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11030791). The result is a system where decision-making processes lock farmers into existing practices rather than motivating them to move toward more sustainable or market-responsive approaches [(Gemtou et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su16072828).

## Impact of Small Profit Margins on Decision-Making

**Summary:** Small profit margins in agriculture intensify farmers' focus on cost-benefit calculations and make them highly sensitive to input costs, but also force them to balance financial considerations with non-financial factors like tradition and social pressure. These tight margins amplify the importance of government interventions while creating situations where farmers may prioritize cash flow over long-term optimization. (5 sources)

The reality of operating with small profit margins fundamentally shapes how farmers approach decision-making, creating a complex interplay between economic rationality and practical constraints that affects everything from input use to technology adoption. Research demonstrates that farmers cannot be regarded as pure profit maximizers, and the fully rational economic behavior does not always hold while modeling farmers, particularly when they must make trade-offs between financial considerations like profit maximization and non-financial considerations such as traditions and social group pressure [(Tol et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.112021). This tension becomes particularly acute when profit margins are thin, as farmers must weigh immediate financial needs against other values and long-term considerations. The pressure of small margins creates heightened sensitivity to input costs and government support programs. Studies show that compared to subsidies, farmers are more conscious of the cost of and earnings from grain production than of subsidies, with farmers trying to assess inputs and outputs rationally [(Shen et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13042176). This heightened cost consciousness is driven by the reality that rapid increases in the cost of planting have become an important factor hindering the growth of farmers' income from grain crops [(Shen et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13042176). The result is that farmers value cash earnings and cash costs rather than the time value of money, focusing on immediate financial impacts rather than longer-term investment strategies [(Shen et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13042176). Agricultural modeling approaches recognize this reality by optimizing based on total gross margin of individual production processes, reflecting economic rationality in farmer decision-making under different market and policy conditions [(Bethwell et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08816-y). However, the constraints of small margins also create vulnerability, where farmers operating as bounded rational decision makers with maximum expected profit as their goal face the possibility of default in cases of low output [(Lu et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202127501016). These tight profit margins make government intervention both more necessary and more impactful. Welfare economics theories explain how governments can address market imperfections in agricultural systems through direct income support, price stabilization mechanisms, and subsidies for farmers who adhere to environmentally friendly production methods [(Mokgomo et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12111760). The government can set minimum prices to guarantee farmers' basic income by subsidizing food prices and build buffer stocks to support price stabilization [(Mokgomo et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12111760). However, when profit margins are already small, government subsidies can reduce financing costs for farmers, though research suggests that the real beneficiaries may sometimes be financial institutions rather than the farmers themselves [(Lu et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202127501016).

## Policy Implications and Agricultural Systems Dependency

**Summary:** Current agricultural policies need to shift from purely economic models to approaches that account for behavioral factors and environmental consequences. The focus on profit maximization has created agricultural systems that damage the environment, requiring policy interventions that address both farmer cognition and technology adoption while recognizing the complex decision-making processes that go beyond simple economic rationality. (3 sources)

The recognition that farmers operate under bounded rationality rather than pure economic optimization has profound implications for how agricultural policies should be designed and implemented. Traditional policy approaches have been built on models focusing exclusively on economic function, with farmers making microeconomic decisions to maximize economic benefits [(Baum et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12041418). However, this narrow focus on private economic rationality over general social rationality has resulted in agricultural development that damages the natural environment and depletes non-renewable resources, while intensification of agricultural production creates adverse environmental impacts [(Baum et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12041418). Effective policy intervention requires understanding that social, psychological, and behavioral factors are important drivers of decision-making processes that deviate from simple profit-maximization assumptions [(Lefebvre et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1746-692x.12324). Research shows that accounting for these factors is key to transitioning to sustainable farming systems, suggesting that policies must be designed with a more nuanced understanding of farmer behavior [(Lefebvre et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1746-692x.12324). Policy intervention serves as an effective means to address agricultural production technology externalities by changing the constraints of farmers' decision-making and acting as a strong determinant of technology adoption [(Yi et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20021146). However, the success of these interventions depends heavily on farmer cognition and awareness. Studies reveal significant gaps between policy intentions and farmer understanding: farmers often have low cognition of environmental pollution caused by chemical fertilizers, insufficient knowledge of fertilizer application and reduction policies, and low willingness to reduce chemical applications [(Yi et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20021146). Even when farmers develop environmentally friendly cognition regarding alternatives like organic fertilizer, this awareness does not automatically translate into changed behavior [(Yi et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20021146). The challenge for policymakers is to design interventions that work with, rather than against, the cognitive limitations and behavioral patterns that characterize real farmer decision-making. This requires moving beyond simple subsidy programs toward more sophisticated approaches that address the psychological and social factors that influence agricultural choices, while also considering the environmental and social costs of continued dependence on production-oriented agricultural systems.
