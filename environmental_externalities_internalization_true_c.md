## Background and Market Failures

**Summary:** Environmental externalities occur when economic activities create costs or benefits not reflected in market prices, leading to overuse of natural resources and environmental degradation. Market failures in ecosystem services and natural capital require government intervention through policy instruments to internalize these external costs. (9 sources)

Environmental externalities represent a fundamental market failure where the true costs and benefits of economic activities are not captured in market prices. Externalities are unintended external effects that occur when the economic activities of one group impact another without proper compensation or payment [(Atuma et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.4236/JEP.2013.410121) [(Richer, 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5339/CONNECT.2014.22). In environmental contexts, these primarily manifest as negative externalities or external costs that represent real costs to society, even though they are not reflected in market prices of goods and services [(Caramanico et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/en14185847). Ecosystem services and natural capital suffer from multiple market failure properties including positive and negative externalities, unclear property rights, open access regimes, and public good characteristics [(Sutton et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND8040054). The scale of this market failure is substantial - estimates suggest ecosystem services are valued at almost twice the size of the entire global market economy, while energy subsidies and energy-related externalities alone amount to approximately $5.3 trillion globally, representing 6.5% of global GDP [(Fankhauser et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2982871) [(Coady et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5089/9781513532196.001.A001). These market failures result in systematic underpricing of environmental resources and overproduction of pollution-intensive goods and services. For example, fossil fuel consumption exceeds socially optimal levels because costs like climate change, air quality degradation, and health impacts are not incorporated into fuel prices [(Richer, 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5339/CONNECT.2014.22). Similarly, industrial processes can pollute surrounding areas and disrupt ecosystem services without bearing the full cost of these impacts [(Fankhauser et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2982871). The conventional market mechanism cannot reflect the true costs and benefits of environmental externalities, as these costs do not appear in corporate income statements or balance sheets [(Rasul et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2021.602475) [(Rechsteiner, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10098-020-01939-3). This creates a need for government intervention through policy instruments to correct market failures and internalize external costs, following the Pigouvian framework which demonstrates that when externalities exist, private and social costs are not equal [(Paukku, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ce/zkab024) [(Atuma et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.4236/JEP.2013.410121).

## Natural Capital Accounting Systems

**Summary:** Natural capital accounting systems extend traditional economic accounting to include the value of natural resources and ecosystem services, providing a framework for internalizing environmental externalities. These systems face significant measurement and coordination challenges but offer pathways to incorporate true environmental costs into economic decision-making. (8 sources)

Natural capital accounting represents a fundamental shift from conventional economic accounting by incorporating the value of natural resources and ecosystem services into financial and national accounting frameworks. Unlike GDP, which only examines the value of goods and services produced by human activity, natural capital accounting seeks to develop a broader and more comprehensive valuation of national wealth that includes assessments of the economic worth of natural resources and ecosystem services [(Landrigan et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.5334/aogh.4161). This approach can aid in internalizing externalities of production and integrating true costs and values of natural resources and ecosystem services into economic activities and public assets [(Clark et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2017.12.013). The fundamental premise behind green accounting is that organizations should internalize environmental costs that are currently externalized, with society bearing the impact of adverse environmental activities [(Moorthy et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.4236/OJACCT.2013.21002). This accounting failure has arguably contributed to the widespread degradation of natural ecosystems, as conservation practices fail to properly recognize the value of natural systems [(Abbasnezhad et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13060893). Environmental costs remain as externalities precisely because they stay outside of economic accounting, creating a need for tools that allow internalizing these externalities back into the price system [(Rodriguez-Labajos et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.4103/0972-4923.125744). The System of Environmental-Economic Accounting-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA) has developed assessment frameworks covering natural capital accounting, emphasizing both physical quantity accounting of environmental resources and monetary valuation methods [(Shi et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su16073078). Natural capital provides the material basis and environmental conditions for human survival and development, characterized by scarcity, mobility, diversity of values, externality, and commonality [(Shi et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su16073078) [(Haile, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5846/stxb201903230549). However, significant challenges exist in implementing natural capital accounting systems. The biggest obstacle to internalizing externalities is the measurement of costs and benefits that result from environmental activities, as it is difficult to measure consistently the impacts of environmental destruction on surrounding communities [(Widianingsih., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.21474/ijar01/7006). Key challenges include coordination issues (vertical or horizontal), allocation, transparency, information sharing, connections, measurement standards and data collection [(Widianingsih., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.21474/ijar01/7006). High-profile initiatives like TEEB (The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity) have attempted to cost in monetary terms the loss of ecosystem services and biodiversity, representing efforts to quantify natural capital under economic frameworks [(Rodriguez-Labajos et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.4103/0972-4923.125744).

## True Cost Accounting Approaches

**Summary:** True Cost Accounting (TCA) is an economic assessment method that accounts for all costs and benefits of production, including environmental and social externalities typically excluded from market prices. TCA frameworks like TEEBAgriFood and Full Cost Accounting provide comprehensive approaches to measure and monetize these hidden costs across multiple capitals. (8 sources)

True Cost Accounting (TCA) is an economic assessment aimed at accounting for externalities in food systems [(Bellon et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0296665). TCA represents a method that accounts for all costs and benefits of a product, including externalities that harm or help other people through the environmental, social, and health consequences of production and consumption [(Kennedy et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cdnut.2023.100028). This approach systematically measures and evaluates the environmental, social, health and economic costs and benefits associated with food production, aiming to assess all impacts, both market and non-market effects [(Marangon et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.36253/rea-14613). The TEEBAgriFood Framework has become a reference for true cost accounting in agri-food systems since its launch in 2018 [(Marangon et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.36253/rea-14613). This framework was developed through a collective effort of about 150 experts using a transdisciplinary approach and is built around four capitals: natural capital (well-functioning biodiversity and ecosystems), human capital (skills and knowledge), produced capital (finance and machinery), and social capital (societal interactions and institutions) [(Sandhu et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1177/2053019619872808). The framework is universal, comprehensive, and inclusive, allowing decision makers to identify externalities, provide information about internalizing environmental costs, and contextualize agricultural systems in economic and environmental policy [(Sandhu et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1177/2053019619872808). Full Cost Accounting (FCA) enables the monetary valuation of social and environmental costs and benefits as well as financial costs, differing from conventional approaches by considering costs borne by other companies and assigning monetary values based on methods like willingness to pay rather than just market prices [(Stone et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.06.037). However, such valuations of environmental and social costs are still challenging for companies to internalize, making FCA more appropriate for national scale investigation by NGOs and governments [(Stone et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.06.037). The scale of hidden costs revealed by TCA approaches is substantial. Global external costs related to health and environmental impacts of agri-food systems are estimated at around $20 trillion, roughly twice the market value of food products at $9 trillion [(Marangon et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.36253/rea-14613). In the United States specifically, while $1.1 trillion is spent directly on food annually, negative externalities from poor diet quality and harmful production systems cost an additional $2.2 trillion, representing approximately $2 in negative externalities for every $1 spent on food [(Kennedy et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cdnut.2023.100028). TCA can be implemented using Life Cycle Analysis methodologies with various databases available to conduct environmental and social assessments and monetize impacts [(Snoek et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.18174/648789). At the farm level, TCA frameworks comprise metrics across the four capitals with specific categories and indicators that can be assessed using bio-physical, descriptive, or quantitative methods [(Sandhu et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13105710). The recognition that mainstream international standards of economic accounting exclude externalities has driven the need for these comprehensive accounting systems that bridge the gap between corporate social responsibility reports and actual company impacts on natural, human, and social resources [(Scialabba et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003050803-108).

## Methods for Internalizing Environmental Externalities

**Summary:** Multiple policy instruments exist to internalize environmental externalities, ranging from classical economic tools like Pigouvian taxes and carbon pricing to innovative mechanisms like payments for ecosystem services and agro-ecological taxes. These methods aim to close the gap between private and social costs by making polluters bear the full costs of their environmental impacts. (8 sources)

### Classical Economic Instruments • **Pigouvian Taxes and Subsidies**: The foundational approach advocated by Pigou involves using taxes and subsidies to close the gap between private and social costs arising from externalities, ensuring more optimal resource allocation when external costs are properly priced [(Biala, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.21511/EE.10(1).2019.01). The best known methods of internalizing externalities are the Coase theorem and the Pigouvian tax, though these are not commonly applied due to complexities in negotiation and difficulties in cost estimation [(Buks et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.17306/JARD.2016.29). • **Carbon Pricing Mechanisms**: Carbon emission rights trading and carbon taxes represent specific applications of Pigouvian principles, allowing CO2 generators to take responsibility for carbon emissions and prompting governments and businesses to internalize external environmental costs [(Ding et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12145560). Carbon pricing has been applied to international carbon emission trading market mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve optimal pollution levels [(Ding et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12145560). ### Market-Based Environmental Instruments • **Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES)**: These instruments compensate for market failures by paying for services like avoided deforestation or watershed protection in forests [(Piplani et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/f12121673). PES represents a transition pathway for internalizing externalities in natural resource management [(Piplani et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/f12121673). • **Agro-ecological Taxes**: Specialized taxes that internalize negative impacts of agricultural activities on the environment by imposing financial penalties on farmers and agricultural enterprises, incentivizing environmentally friendly practices and promoting efficient resource utilization [(Li et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su151612365). ### Regulatory and Administrative Approaches • **State Intervention and Integration**: Beyond market-based instruments, state authorities can use various instruments of indirect valuation of external effects, though their application faces acceptance challenges [(Buks et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.17306/JARD.2016.29). Integration through merger of stakeholders represents another approach to internalization [(Buks et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.17306/JARD.2016.29). • **Flexible Government Regulation**: Comprehensive approaches combining incentive mechanisms with legislative deterrents, including environmentally friendly cadastral planning, fines, and taxes [(Mirzabaev et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.32609/j.ruje.8.78376). ### Accounting-Based Methods • **Environmental Cost Integration**: The most effective method involves treating environmental factors as production factors like labor and capital, adding them into the production process so that environmental cost becomes part of total production costs [(Ouyang, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/598/1/012025). • **Full Cost Accounting Monetization**: External effects are internalized through abatement or damage cost approaches using willingness-to-pay/sell methods, the two most common approaches for monetizing external effects [(Miehe et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su142013603). • **Life Cycle Assessment Tools**: Accounting for social and ecological impacts along product value chains to internalize externalities throughout the production process [(Piplani et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/f12121673).

## Challenges in Implementation

**Summary:** Implementing environmental externality internalization faces significant obstacles including measurement difficulties, lack of property rights over natural capital, information asymmetries, and the fundamental problem that environmental costs often exceed the total value generated by economic activities. Traditional accounting frameworks are inadequate for capturing externalities, requiring new methodologies and disclosure systems. (6 sources)

The most fundamental challenge in implementing environmental externality internalization is the measurement problem. Although accounting standards provide clear guidance on environmental costs, the biggest obstacle to internalizing externalities is measuring the costs and benefits that result from environmental activities [(Widianingsih., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.21474/ijar01/7006). It is extremely difficult to measure consistently the impacts of environmental destruction on surrounding communities caused by air pollution, wastewater, leakage, crop destruction and other environmental damages, with these costs sometimes being impossible to measure through conventional accounting methods [(Widianingsih., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.21474/ijar01/7006). A crucial structural problem lies in the absence of property rights over natural capital. An underlying cause of the inability to develop effective systems for internalizing externalities is that factors such as natural capital are not subject to rights of ownership to begin with [(Ochi, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.5430/IJFR.V9N4P19). This creates a fundamental challenge in how to create situations where individual economic actors must address externalities as issues that concern them directly when no clear ownership structure exists [(Ochi, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.5430/IJFR.V9N4P19). The scale of environmental costs presents another major implementation barrier. The impossibility for corporations to internalize environmental costs stems from the fact that the total value generated by their activity is often less than the monetary expression of the value of natural heritage destroyed by that activity [(Marques, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-47527-7_13). The estimated cost of environmental impacts for the world's primary sectors amounts to almost $7.3 trillion, equivalent to 13% of global economic output, making full internalization economically unfeasible for many businesses [(Marques, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-47527-7_13). Information asymmetries create market failures that prevent effective internalization. Acts intended to maximize surface-level profits depending on externalities have been encouraged due to market failures arising from adverse selection, resulting from the inability to differentiate between companies that exploit natural capital and those that do not [(Ochi, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.5430/IJFR.V9N4P19). This stems from the inability to discern the real price or cost of environmental impacts [(Ochi, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.5430/IJFR.V9N4P19). Traditional accounting frameworks are fundamentally inadequate for capturing externalities. Financial accounting does not recognize the economic concept of an externality - the costs and benefits incurred by unrelated third parties as side effects of transactions between other parties [(Zyznarska-Dworczak, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12239936). The crucial problem is how to account for various items that do not have market prices, such as pollution, landscape quality, biodiversity and environmental degradation from natural resource depletion [(Jupe et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5901/AJIS.2014.V3N3P283). Operational challenges in natural capital accounting include coordination issues (both vertical and horizontal), allocation problems, transparency requirements, information sharing difficulties, connection challenges, and the need for standardized measurement and data collection methods [(Widianingsih., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.21474/ijar01/7006). While various theoretical solutions exist like sustainable cost accounting, full cost accounting, input-output analysis, and natural capital inventory accounting, these have still not been successfully applied in practice [(Zyznarska-Dworczak, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12239936). Recent efforts to address these challenges focus on developing externality accounting that would parallel traditional income statements. The reporting of environmental externalities currently lacks the distinction between accounting and disclosure that characterizes financial reporting, with widespread impact disclosures but an absence of systematic "externality accounting" [(Barker et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/01559982.2023.2277982). Proposed solutions involve grounding measurement in the physical maintenance of natural capital using replacement cost approaches to reduce measurement uncertainty and make externalities commensurate with financial profit [(Barker et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/01559982.2023.2277982).

## Sectoral Applications and Case Studies

**Summary:** Environmental externality internalization has been applied across multiple sectors including agriculture, water resources, manufacturing, and sustainability markets. These applications demonstrate both the substantial scale of hidden costs and the practical challenges of implementing true cost accounting systems. (7 sources)

### Agriculture and Food Systems • **Agricultural Externalities**: Agriculture produces significant negative externalities where market prices do not reflect the full costs of production, causing consumers to purchase and consume too many harmful products relative to optimal levels [(Schlapfer, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12156126). Those who produce in environmentally friendly ways may be outcompeted by inexpensive but environmentally harmful forms of production, creating both efficiency and fairness issues that require environmental taxes to internalize externalities [(Schlapfer, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12156126). • **Natural Resource Extraction**: Environmental costs in manufacturing and extraction industries have been gradually incorporated through economic and accounting instruments, with regulations establishing emission standards, sanctions for noncompliance, fees and taxes for resource use or degradation (such as oil royalties), and environmental crime legislation [(Oliveira et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.36776/ribsp.v3i7.87). The internalization of environmental costs in productive chains and natural resource consumption has become methodologically consolidated within legal frameworks [(Oliveira et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.36776/ribsp.v3i7.87). ### Watershed and Ecosystem Management • **Forest Ecosystem Services**: The Economics of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Initiative (TEEB) has demonstrated how ecosystem service values can be incorporated into policy decisions for sustainable development [(Adhikari et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.4103/0972-4923.125748). Watershed management applications include soil erosion control, rainwater storage, and regulation of downstream water flow through forest cover maintenance in upper watershed reaches [(Adhikari et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.4103/0972-4923.125748). • **Incentive-Based Mechanisms**: Natural and human-managed ecosystems generate environmental externalities that can be internalized through incentive-based mechanisms, encouraging individuals to account for the effects of their actions on others and leading to more efficient outcomes [(Adhikari et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.4103/0972-4923.125748). ### Manufacturing and Industrial Applications • **Corporate Environmental Accounting**: Economic activities create external costs that become societal burdens when not included in company income statements, making economic valuation of the environment vital for calculating externality values and determining environmental management policies and corporate accounting [(Maszudi et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/575/1/012048). • **Life Cycle Costing**: Applications in manufacturing include estimates of externalities related to natural resource extraction and use, particularly water use and land use changes that trigger changes in ecosystem service provision [(Mela et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13094870). ### Sustainability Market Transitions • **Market Transformation**: The shift from traditional markets to sustainability markets requires internalization of social and environmental costs associated with economic activity, where full cost internalization ends the circular traditional economy illusion by reflecting all costs in pricing mechanisms [(Munoz, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.35409/ijbmer.2020.3171). Sustainability markets take responsibility for externalities they produce, generating resources needed to close the sustainability cycle of production-consumption-externalities management [(Munoz, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.35409/ijbmer.2020.3171). ### Environmental Economics Applications • **Comprehensive Valuation**: Environmental economics applications focus on quantifying the economic value of environmental goods and services including access to clean water, clean air, forests for carbon sequestration, wildlife survival, and biodiversity [(Niekerk, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su16031128). These applications balance human capital and natural capital with financial capital rather than treating them as externalities [(Niekerk, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su16031128).
