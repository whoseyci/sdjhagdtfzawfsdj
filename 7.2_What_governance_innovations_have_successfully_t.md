---

## Introduction

**Summary:** Mediterranean regions have used various governance innovations like participatory decision-making, certification schemes, and integrated water management to make agriculture more sustainable. These approaches combine policy tools, economic incentives, and collaborative management to address environmental challenges while supporting rural livelihoods. (LLM Memory)

Mediterranean agricultural systems face unique sustainability challenges due to water scarcity, soil degradation, climate change, and the need to balance traditional farming practices with environmental protection. Governance innovations in these regions have emerged as critical mechanisms to transform agricultural practices toward sustainability while maintaining economic viability and cultural heritage. These innovations typically involve new institutional arrangements that bring together multiple stakeholders, create economic incentives for sustainable practices, and develop integrated management approaches that address the interconnected nature of agricultural, water, and land resources. Successful governance transformations in Mediterranean agriculture often combine top-down policy frameworks with bottom-up participatory approaches, creating hybrid governance models that can adapt to local conditions while achieving broader sustainability goals. The effectiveness of these innovations stems from their ability to align economic incentives with environmental objectives, facilitate knowledge transfer between research and practice, and create collaborative platforms where farmers, policymakers, researchers, and civil society can work together to develop and implement sustainable agricultural solutions .

## Multi-actor and Participatory Governance Models

**Summary:** Mediterranean regions have successfully used multi-actor governance models that bring together farmers, policymakers, researchers, and civil society to create shared responsibility for sustainable agriculture. These participatory approaches help develop context-specific solutions and build stakeholder ownership of sustainability initiatives. (4 sources)

Multi-actor governance models have emerged as a key innovation for transforming Mediterranean agriculture toward sustainability by creating platforms for collaboration between diverse stakeholders. These models recognize that sustainable agricultural transformation requires coordinated actions involving policy makers, academia, the scientific community, farmers, food industry representatives, civil society, and consumer organizations working together at local, national, and regional levels [(Lacirignola et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2014.00023). The effectiveness of this approach has been demonstrated through transdisciplinary processes that successfully create a culture of shared responsibility among public, private, academic, and civil society actors, helping to balance profitability concerns with sustainability goals [(Castro et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16214097). Participatory governance approaches have proven particularly valuable in developing context-specific solutions for Mediterranean agricultural challenges. These models foster collaboration and stakeholder ownership, providing actionable insights that address complex resource management issues in resource-stressed regions [(Malamataris et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2025.1469762). The participatory framework extends beyond traditional agricultural policy to include diverse interventions such as training and support activities for land managers through extension services, environmental education to increase citizen awareness, preservation of traditional pastoral and farming cultures, and facilitation of cooperation among farmers and broader stakeholders [(Plieninger et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-12647-260323). This multi-faceted approach enables the scaling up of successful local multi-actor partnerships within broader regional regulatory frameworks, creating a comprehensive governance structure that can adapt to local conditions while achieving regional sustainability objectives.

## Certification and Quality Schemes

**Summary:** Mediterranean regions have used certification systems like Protected Designations of Origin (PDO) and eco-labels to transform agriculture by linking sustainable practices to market value. These quality schemes create economic incentives for farmers to adopt environmentally friendly methods while strengthening local food identity and territorial governance. (2 sources)

Certification and quality schemes have emerged as powerful governance tools for driving sustainable agricultural transformation in Mediterranean regions by creating market-based incentives that reward environmentally friendly practices. European certifications such as Protected Designations of Origin (PDO) and Protected Geographical Indications (PGI), along with local labels from agricultural parks, participatory guarantee systems, and eco-labels, have successfully improved the identification of identity-based foods while contributing to the strengthening of good agricultural practices [(Ochoa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land9060177). These certification systems work by enhancing territorial governance to increase the market value of indigenous varieties through differentiation strategies that add value to products and strengthen local economies [(Ochoa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land9060177). The effectiveness of quality schemes in promoting sustainability has been demonstrated through their integration with advisory systems and producer organizations. Research on Mediterranean olive groves shows that simple environmentally friendly practices like no-tillage, mulching of pruning residuals, and organic material supply can enhance agroecosystem resilience and help farms adapt to climate change, with these results being incorporated into agri-environmental policy frameworks to support circular economy principles [(Duvaleix et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122410457). The governance of quality schemes through producer organizations, supported by appropriate information tools, creates a comprehensive system that enhances adoption of environmentally friendly practices, promotes agricultural sector sustainability, and supports long-term territorial development [(Duvaleix et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122410457). This approach has proven particularly effective when combined with participatory patrimonialization processes that strengthen ties between food, identity, and local communities, creating a holistic governance model that addresses both environmental and socio-cultural sustainability objectives [(Ochoa et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land9060177).

## Economic Incentives and Policy Frameworks

**Summary:** Mediterranean regions have transformed agricultural practices through economic incentives like agri-environmental payments, conservation easements, and reformed subsidy schemes that reward sustainable practices. These policy frameworks shift from production-based support to payments for ecosystem services and multifunctional land use. (3 sources)

Economic incentives and policy frameworks have become essential governance tools for driving sustainable agricultural transformation in Mediterranean regions by aligning financial rewards with environmental outcomes. The European Union's agri-environmental programs exemplify this approach, where governments pay farmers to voluntarily adapt their operations to benefit biodiversity and the environment [(Cox et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014508). Similar incentive-based programs have expanded in other Mediterranean regions, with California's 2008 Farm Bill generating almost $54 million for farmers and ranchers, much of it directed to areas within the Mediterranean biome through time-bound voluntary contracts and permanent conservation easements [(Cox et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014508). Policy frameworks are evolving toward more comprehensive support systems that address structural challenges in Mediterranean agriculture. Reformed agricultural policies now emphasize support for young farmers, innovative farms, and transitions to organic agriculture, specifically targeting the low income of farmers and lack of interest in farming activities among young generations [(Heider et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-020-01739-x). These frameworks promote farms that use agroecological practices, sell directly to urban customers, and process products in-house, contributing to regeneration of degraded lands, reinforcement of local food chains, and revival of local employment [(Heider et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-020-01739-x). The transformation of funding models represents a significant governance innovation, with suggested economic incentives focusing on converting agricultural support into payment schemes for multiple ecosystem services rather than production-based subsidies [(Plieninger et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-12647-260323). This includes better support for low-intensity farming and extensive grazing, targeted conservation payments for specific plant or bird assemblages, and tax breaks that are regionally specific and foster cooperation among private landowners [(Plieninger et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-12647-260323). These policy innovations create comprehensive frameworks that support multifunctionality, heterogeneity, and sustainability of land use while providing clear legal definitions of sustainable management practices.

## Territorial and District-based Governance

**Summary:** Mediterranean regions have developed territorial governance models like bio-districts and agri-food districts that organize sustainable agriculture at the regional level. These district-based approaches combine local community cooperation with institutional support to create integrated systems that address both agricultural practices and broader socio-economic development. (3 sources)

Territorial and district-based governance models have emerged as innovative approaches for organizing sustainable agricultural transformation at the regional level in Mediterranean areas. These models focus on creating cooperative networks among rural communities that can help revitalize areas disadvantaged by globalization effects. Regional economic cooperation through territorial governance has proven effective for long-term rural community development by promoting cooperative reliance and trans-boundary economic cooperation that reconfigures community economies in ways consistent with traditional environmental practices [(Zaferatos, 2011)](https://doi.org/10.5539/JSD.V4N1P23). Key mechanisms within these territorial approaches include farmer cooperatives, controlled appellation systems, product traceability, and origin-based labeling that strengthen local agricultural economies [(Zaferatos, 2011)](https://doi.org/10.5539/JSD.V4N1P23). Bio-districts represent a particularly successful example of territorial governance innovation in Mediterranean regions, especially in Italy where they have provided positive feedback for sustainable agricultural transformation. These district-based systems act on territorial specificities through strategic actions that define criteria and practices adapted to local conditions, while involving effective institutional governance and providing information and training for both agricultural operators and citizens [(Gargano et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13042215). The Italian experience with bio-districts demonstrates how farm diversification systems can anticipate broader policy strategies by simultaneously addressing agricultural practices alongside ethical and social aspects through community involvement [(Gargano et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13042215). Agri-food districts represent another territorial governance innovation with significant potential for achieving local and regional policy goals aligned with sustainable approaches in agricultural policy frameworks. These district organizations focus on strengthening capacity-building through improved internal governance and sustainable production chain development, while implementing initiatives to attract young people to rural areas and establishing agreements for ecosystem services delivery [(Tarangioli et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.24294/jipd.v8i10.5914). This district-based approach creates comprehensive territorial management systems that integrate agricultural sustainability with broader regional development objectives.

## Knowledge Transfer and Advisory Systems

**Summary:** Mediterranean regions have developed innovative knowledge transfer systems that use digital platforms and producer organizations to help farmers adopt sustainable practices. These advisory systems combine scientific research with practical tools, achieving significant water savings and yield improvements while building trusted networks for spreading environmental practices. (2 sources)

Knowledge transfer and advisory systems have become critical governance innovations for scaling sustainable agricultural practices across Mediterranean regions by bridging the gap between research and practical implementation. Digital platforms represent a significant advancement in this area, with tools like the SUPROMED project demonstrating how online platforms can adapt scientific models to end-user requirements for increasing economic and environmental sustainability. This platform was validated across three Mediterranean demonstration sites and achieved remarkable results, with the simplified tool reaching similar or higher yields than traditional farming while using less water, resulting in average water savings of 16% and yield increases of 10% [(Dominguez et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w15091691). Producer organizations (POs) have emerged as particularly effective knowledge transfer mechanisms because farmers consider them informed and trusted sources for decision-making. Research in Mediterranean olive groves has shown that simple environmentally friendly practices can enhance agroecosystem resilience and help farms adapt to climate change, with results being incorporated into agri-environmental policy frameworks [(Duvaleix et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122410457). The governance structure around these advisory systems has evolved to support networks of producer organizations rather than scattered individual advisors, as associations of POs can more efficiently provide advisory services by facilitating knowledge exchange, increasing complementarities, and decreasing costs [(Duvaleix et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122410457). The success of these knowledge transfer innovations stems from their integration with broader policy frameworks and their ability to generate interest across multiple stakeholder groups. Digital advisory tools have attracted attention from technicians, farmers, advisory enterprises, and governmental extension services, with regional and national authorities showing interest in spreading these tools across their territories [(Dominguez et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w15091691). This multi-level adoption validates the methodology used for adapting and transferring scientific knowledge to the productive sector while creating sustainable pathways for long-term agricultural transformation.

## Integrated Water Governance

**Summary:** Mediterranean regions have developed integrated water governance schemes that combine systematic monitoring with transparent management systems to help farming organizations efficiently manage water resources. These approaches have been successfully implemented across multiple countries and demonstrate how coordinated water management can save resources while improving agricultural sustainability. (1 source)

Integrated water governance has emerged as a critical innovation for addressing water scarcity challenges in Mediterranean agriculture through comprehensive management systems that coordinate multiple stakeholders and resources. The development of integrated water governance schemes specifically designed for farming organizations represents a significant advancement in sustainable agricultural management. These schemes combine systematic monitoring and evaluation strategies with transparent internal dissemination processes to increase implementation efficiency and resource conservation [(Sismani et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w16081103). The practical implementation of integrated water governance has shown promising results across Mediterranean regions, with successful adoption by farming organizations in both Greece and Italy. The water management systems developed as implementation tools for these governance schemes provide concrete mechanisms for translating policy frameworks into operational practices. Experience from pilot implementations has revealed that the effectiveness of integrated water governance depends heavily on systematic monitoring and evaluation processes, which not only increase implementation efficiency but also help save valuable water resources [(Sismani et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w16081103). The success of integrated water governance initiatives also highlights the critical importance of internal communication and transparency within farming organizations. These governance innovations demonstrate how coordinated water management approaches can be scaled across different Mediterranean contexts while maintaining effectiveness, providing a model for broader regional adoption of sustainable water management practices in agriculture [(Sismani et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w16081103).

## Nature-based Solutions and Agroecological Governance

**Summary:** Mediterranean regions have adopted nature-based solutions and agroecological governance frameworks that integrate traditional practices like terracing and agroforestry with modern conservation techniques. These approaches use participatory stakeholder processes to develop context-specific solutions that enhance biodiversity while maintaining agricultural productivity. (8 sources)

Nature-based solutions (NBSs) combined with agroecological governance frameworks have emerged as transformative approaches for sustainable agriculture in Mediterranean regions, offering comprehensive systems that address environmental challenges while maintaining productivity. The agroecology concept provides a holistic framework through its 10 elements: diversity, synergies, efficiency, resilience, recycling, co-creation and sharing of knowledge, human and social values, culture and food traditions, responsible governance, and circular and solidarity economy [(Turetta et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/foods10030521). These elements create integrated governance systems that optimize agricultural sustainability while respecting traditional practices and local contexts. Mediterranean regions have successfully implemented diverse nature-based solutions tailored to their specific environmental challenges. In regions like Apulia and Basilicata, NBSs address soil erosion and degradation through minimum tillage, cover cropping, and crop rotation, while water scarcity challenges are met with rainwater harvesting, drought-resistant crop varieties, and restoration of traditional water systems like canals and terracing [(Netti et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-76346-5) [(Kassam et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00207233.2018.1494927) [(Rinaldi et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12051112). Agroforestry systems have proven particularly effective, with terraced agroforestry systems in mountainous areas of Apulia integrating fruit trees with vegetables or cereals to conserve biodiversity and soil and water resources [(Netti et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-76346-5) [(Ali et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy14030472). Crop rotation practices, such as rotating wheat with legumes like chickpeas, have demonstrated significant environmental benefits including 18% reduction in global warming impacts and 20% reduction in freshwater ecotoxicity, while increasing gross margins by 96% [(Netti et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-76346-5) [(Zabala et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-023-01413-1). The governance of nature-based solutions relies heavily on participatory approaches that place farmers at the center of change processes. Effective governance requires encouraging and guiding farmers through appropriate incentives and practices to conserve natural ecosystems and biodiversity while minimizing agriculture's negative environmental impact [(Failla et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11010106). Stakeholder engagement has proven crucial for successful implementation, with collaborative methodologies fostering stakeholder ownership and providing actionable insights that promote context-specific solutions for addressing complex resource management challenges [(Malamataris et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2025.1469762). This participatory governance approach has demonstrated effectiveness across multiple Mediterranean contexts, with Italian case studies showing 24 proposed NBSs related to agricultural landscape management, highlighting the importance of transdisciplinary tools in addressing sustainability challenges and offering replicable frameworks for sustainable resource management in resource-stressed regions [(Malamataris et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2025.1469762).
