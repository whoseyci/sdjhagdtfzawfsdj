## Introduction/Background

**Summary:** Institutional inertia and path dependency create powerful lock-in mechanisms that make it hard to change existing systems, leading to governance failures and barriers in implementing environmental and agricultural policies needed for sustainability transitions. These structural obstacles prevent transformation even when change is clearly needed. (LLM Memory)

Institutional inertia refers to the tendency of organizations, systems, and policies to resist change and maintain existing patterns of behavior, even when those patterns are no longer effective or beneficial . This resistance to change often stems from path dependency, where past decisions and investments create self-reinforcing cycles that make it increasingly difficult and costly to pursue alternative approaches . Lock-in mechanisms emerge from these processes, creating structural constraints that trap systems in suboptimal states and prevent adaptive responses to new challenges . In the context of environmental and agricultural policy, these dynamics manifest as governance failures where existing institutional frameworks cannot adequately address complex sustainability challenges . The result is a persistent gap between policy intentions and implementation outcomes, where barriers embedded in institutional structures prevent the transformative changes needed for sustainability transitions . Understanding these interconnected concepts is crucial for identifying why current systems struggle to adapt to environmental pressures and how structural obstacles can be overcome to enable meaningful transformation .

## Types and Mechanisms of Lock-in

**Summary:** Lock-in mechanisms operate across multiple dimensions - technological, institutional, behavioral, political, and economic - creating interlocking systems that resist change through self-reinforcing processes like increasing returns, sunk costs, and powerful actor coalitions defending the status quo. (10 sources)

Lock-in mechanisms can be categorized into several distinct but interconnected types that collectively create system stability and resistance to change. Technological lock-in occurs when early adoption of particular technologies creates increasing returns to scale, learning effects, and network effects that make alternative technologies increasingly difficult to adopt, even when they may be superior [(Arfan et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w12061656) [(Bolton et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.EIST.2014.07.005). This process is reinforced by infrastructure investments with long time horizons that can lock systems into potentially undesirable trajectories [(Bolton et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.EIST.2014.07.005). Institutional lock-in emerges from path-dependent processes where established actor coalitions with significant influence and resources maintain trajectories that correspond with their interests [(Seebauer et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-023-02029-y). These mechanisms include political authority, institutional density where paths become deeply embedded in existing structures, and the management of collective goods that require coordination between multiple actors [(Seebauer et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-023-02029-y). Institutional lock-in is often more prevalent than technology-based mechanisms and manifests through ingrained arrangements where powerful coalitions preserve their interests alongside dominant discourses [(Seebauer et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-023-02029-y). Behavioral and cognitive lock-in involves habits, norms, and mental models that shape demand patterns and decision-making processes [(Susskind et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fbuil.2020.00021). In agricultural systems, these mechanisms include various forms of increasing returns to adoption where technology, infrastructure, and knowledge develop around initially adopted practices, making them relatively superior over time even if inferior alternatives exist [(Williams et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-024-01480-y). Risk aversion and loss aversion further reinforce existing practices through sunk costs of investments [(Williams et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-024-01480-y). The most powerful lock-in situations arise from the dynamic interaction of multiple mechanisms across different dimensions. These create what scholars describe as "interdependent webs" where institutions, technologies, and behaviors mutually reinforce each other [(Knaggard et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-025-02382-0) [(Pierson, 2000)](https://doi.org/10.2307/2586011). In socio-technical systems, lock-in occurs when interlinkages between material factors (technology, infrastructure), human actors, and non-material factors (institutions, knowledge, incentives) collectively create system stability that resists environmentally superior alternatives [(Trencher et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.ERSS.2020.101770). This multi-dimensional nature means that institutions become stabilized through multiple interactions with industrial practices, technology, infrastructure, cultural codes, consumer practices, and administrative routines [(Newig et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-10700-240118) [(Folke et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03610-150420).

## Path Dependency and Self-Reinforcing Processes

**Summary:** Path dependency creates self-reinforcing cycles where past decisions constrain future options through increasing returns processes, making it progressively more costly to change direction. These dynamics become locked in through positive feedback mechanisms that automatically reproduce existing arrangements, even when they are suboptimal. (13 sources)

Path dependency represents a fundamental mechanism through which systems become trapped in particular trajectories based on historical decisions and contingent events. At its core, path dependency operates through a dynamic of "increasing returns," where the costs of changing policy or institutional direction become progressively higher over time [(Font et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03344-150225) [(Pierson, 2000)](https://doi.org/10.2307/2586011). This process means that specific patterns of timing and sequence matter enormously, and particular courses of action, once introduced, can become almost impossible to reverse [(Pierson, 2000)](https://doi.org/10.2307/2586011). The self-reinforcing nature of path dependency distinguishes lock-in mechanisms from simple inertia or transition barriers [(Simoens et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01110-5). These processes create what scholars describe as "self-reproducing mechanisms" including sunk costs, vested interests, economies of scale, and policy feedback mechanisms that generate and maintain stability in institutional arrangements [(Svensson et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12052129). Once established, institutional logic becomes extremely difficult to reverse, explaining the typically incremental nature of politics and gradual development of public policies [(Svensson et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12052129). Path dependency manifests through multiple interconnected dimensions that reinforce each other over time. In energy systems, for example, industrial economies become locked into fossil fuel-based systems through technological and institutional co-evolution driven by path-dependent increasing returns to scale [(Beeton et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-09157-220209) [(Han et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11020469). Infrastructure lock-in creates self-reinforcing systems where existing networks of pipelines, refineries, and distribution systems favor continued use of established technologies [(Moller et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3390/biomimetics10060406). These technical structures become reinforced by incumbent actor coalitions and management paradigms that defend their positions, power, and resources [(Seebauer et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-023-02029-y). The policy feedback effects of path dependency create particularly powerful lock-in dynamics. Policies alter state capacities, change incentives for collective action, and encourage social adaptations that become difficult to reverse [(Edmondson et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.RESPOL.2018.03.010). This generates two types of feedback effects: distributing resources and creating material incentives that strengthen particular social interest groups, and transforming state capacities and institutions in ways that affect later prospects for policy implementation [(Mori, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.EIST.2021.02.003) [(Pierson, 2000)](https://doi.org/10.2307/2586011). Importantly, path dependency often leads to systematic reproduction of problems that governance reforms seek to resolve. New integrated initiatives become layered on top of existing policies and institutions without considering broader consequences, creating "business as usual" approaches that transmit inherent flaws into supposedly transformed regimes [(Kelly et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00213). This institutional layering means that fragmented governance arrangements and suboptimal resource management often persist even after governance regimes have been officially "transformed" [(Kelly et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00213). The most challenging aspect of path dependency is that it can lead to institutional lock-ins where rule sets become too complex to apply or no longer produce desired outcomes, potentially causing persistent policy failures and inadequate governance [(Meijer et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14649357.2024.2399663). However, lock-ins are not merely unintended side effects of historical decisions - they are also actively strengthened and deepened through coordinated efforts by actors with interests in maintaining existing arrangements [(Tilsted et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2023.05.018). This means that breaking existing lock-ins requires both credible long-term signals about transformation directions and powerful short-term interventions to reshape current investment cycles [(Tilsted et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2023.05.018).

## Governance Failures and Policy Implementation Barriers

**Summary:** Governance failures emerge when institutional inertia and path dependency create barriers that prevent effective policy implementation, leading to coordination failures, rigid governance arrangements, and sub-optimal outcomes even when stakeholders recognize the need for change. These barriers include failed institutional rules, conflicting actor coalitions, lack of institutional leadership, and the tendency of governance systems to reproduce dominant decision-making approaches that perpetuate unsustainable practices. (13 sources)

Governance failures in environmental and sustainability contexts arise directly from the institutional inertia and lock-in mechanisms described earlier, manifesting as systematic barriers that prevent effective policy implementation and coordination. These barriers emerge from failed institutional rules, institutional conflicts when new ideas clash with prevailing environments, path dependencies, locked-in effects, and lack of dedicated institutions or institutional leadership [(Jetoo, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W10040400). The result is that governance systems become trapped in coordination failures prone to mutual defection strategies due to power dynamics and discursive-institutional inertia [(Mendez et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01258-0). A key dimension of governance failure involves systemic failures where regional innovation systems do not function efficiently because of weakly developed institutions or insufficient incentives to participate in innovation processes [(Konstantynova, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21681376.2017.1322528). Old industrial regions particularly struggle with escaping path dependency, with agglomerations of mature industries obstructing path creation and switching processes through functional, cognitive, and political lock-in mechanisms [(Konstantynova, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21681376.2017.1322528). Institutional constraints fundamentally limit the range of policy choices available to policymakers, with policies that compete with existing norms, rules, and conventions of social behavior likely to be ineffective or rejected [(Gussmann et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-020-02919-8). This creates situations where institutions fail to effectively adapt established practices to face changing circumstances, leading to maladaptive outcomes where inferior practices become locked-in and perpetuate inefficient behaviors [(Kauffman et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su131910708) [(Pierson, 2000)](https://doi.org/10.2307/2586011). The most challenging governance failures arise from complex actor constellations within rigid governance arrangements characterized by ingrained rules and norms, incorrect or incomplete knowledge, vested interests and competing agendas, unclear institutional roles, or lack of policy guidance to manage restricted resources [(Hanger-Kopp et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.102425). These institutional barriers cause adaptation measures to miss opportunities, be postponed, downgraded, or not implemented at all, leading to sub-optimal outcomes [(Hanger-Kopp et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.102425). Governance activities often reproduce dominant decision-making and resource organization approaches that demonstrate strong institutional lock-ins and path dependence, proving unfavorable for sustainability transitions [(Zhang, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/1523908X.2024.2353039). Institutions impose inertia on potential change through embedded practices and approaches, lack of vision by key decision-makers, and the tendency of governments to be influenced by dominant regimes [(Essex et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1080/17535069.2023.2261899). This creates a fundamental tension where adaptive governance principles emphasize flexibility and adaptation, while institutional inertia indicates a tendency to maintain existing systems and policies even when they are ineffective or outdated [(Luqito et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.20473/jap.v15i2.52874) [(Pierson, 2000)](https://doi.org/10.2307/2586011). Perhaps most problematically, governance failures are often perpetuated by entrenched economic and political interests that gain from the present system through the exercise of monopoly power, financial privilege and control, advertising, and regulatory and political capture, even when citizens as a whole may not benefit or may be harmed [(Ashford et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU3010270). These lock-ins structure interactions among partner agencies and are responsible for conflicts between partners, reflected in differences in legal and statutory responsibilities, management approaches, and institutional cultures [(Kittinger et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.1155/2011/241374). The fragmentation of governance approaches hinders the development of coordinated solutions, with discipline-specific terminology and approaches preventing the integration necessary for successful system transformations [(Oliver et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1017/sus.2018.9).

## Institutional Inertia in Environmental and Agricultural Policy

**Summary:** Environmental and agricultural policies face particularly strong institutional inertia because incumbent actors in government and markets actively resist transformative change to maintain their positions. This creates deep lock-ins in agri-food systems where technological, economic, and political mechanisms reinforce unsustainable practices even when climate action is officially prioritized. (5 sources)

Environmental and agricultural policy domains demonstrate particularly pronounced forms of institutional inertia that systematically undermine sustainability transitions. In these sectors, institutional inertia manifests as the tendency of political institutions to resist change and stabilize existing policies through mechanisms including costs, uncertainty, path dependency, power dynamics, and legitimacy concerns [(Dornelles et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1017/sus.2020.15). This resistance proves especially problematic for international cooperation on sustainability goals, where the persistence of policy disconnects among countries—such as unsustainable agricultural subsidies and land-use reforms—impairs the partnerships needed for achieving sustainable development objectives [(Dornelles et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1017/sus.2020.15). The fundamental challenge in these policy areas stems from the fact that government and established markets are inherently incumbent actors who seek to optimize their positions within existing regimes rather than pursue transformative change [(Loorbach, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40410-022-00176-z). As actors develop routines, establish institutions, invest in technology and infrastructure, and develop established positions, it becomes increasingly difficult to change fundamentally [(Loorbach, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40410-022-00176-z). This creates a situation where incumbent actors generally have negative interests in transitions and will work against transformative change until it becomes inevitable [(Loorbach, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40410-022-00176-z). Agricultural systems demonstrate particularly deep lock-ins through multiple reinforcing mechanisms that go beyond simple inertia. These systems become trapped through various forms of increasing returns to adoption, where technology, infrastructure, and knowledge develop around initially adopted practices—such as cereal crops or genetic engineering—making them relatively superior over time even when inferior alternatives exist [(Williams et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-024-01480-y). The resistance to change is actively maintained through conscious efforts by highly capitalized actors who exercise power through lobbying and spreading misinformation to influence public opinion and policy decisions, such as downplaying pesticide risks to human health [(Williams et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-024-01480-y). Even when climate action becomes part of official strategies, institutional inertia undermines implementation through competitive interests between different administrative branches that work against strategic climate orientation [(Moilanen et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.138938) [(Reinekoski et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1177/00380261221123186). Municipal organizations treat climate issues as auxiliary concerns and subsume them as separate, precarious projects, with various conflicting organizational rhythms leaving climate experts in contentious positions where they must constantly devise strategies to keep climate issues on the agenda [(Moilanen et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.138938) [(Reinekoski et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1177/00380261221123186). State interventions in environmental and agricultural policy typically reinforce orthodox ideologies based on economic growth, making it difficult for transformative solutions to gain traction [(Williams et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-024-01480-y). These sociopolitical processes interact dynamically with technological and behavioral mechanisms across multiple scales to produce deep lock-ins that resist the systemic changes needed for sustainability transitions [(Williams et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-024-01480-y). Moving beyond this institutional inertia requires more longitudinal policy strategies, explicit focus on actors and capabilities, and connecting policy implementation more directly to transformation visions [(Moilanen et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.138938).

## Overcoming Lock-in: Transformation Strategies

**Summary:** Breaking out of institutional lock-ins requires strategic interventions that target vulnerable parts of existing systems, coordinate pressure across multiple levels, and actively counter the efforts of actors who work to maintain current arrangements. Success depends on both credible long-term transformation signals and powerful short-term interventions that reshape investment cycles. (6 sources)

Overcoming institutional inertia and lock-in mechanisms requires understanding that these systems are not simply the inevitable result of path dependency, but are actively maintained and strengthened through coordinated efforts by actors with vested interests [(Tilsted et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2023.05.018). This recognition fundamentally changes the approach to transformation - rather than waiting for gradual change or external shocks, it becomes possible to develop strategic interventions that directly challenge the mechanisms maintaining lock-in. The prospects for breaking existing lock-ins through political interventions depend on two critical factors: the credibility of long-term signals about economy-wide transformation directions and the power of short-term interventions to reshape current investment cycles [(Tilsted et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2023.05.018). This dual approach recognizes that transformation requires both clear vision and immediate action to disrupt self-reinforcing cycles. Strategic approaches to unlocking institutional regimes can target specific vulnerable points within locked-in systems. These strategies include attacking an institution's vulnerable parts such as unpopular subsidies for incumbent industries, exerting aligned pressure onto existing regimes, and developing coherent policy mixes that coordinate interventions across multiple dimensions [(Newig et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-10700-240118). The success of these approaches stems from recognizing that institutions are stabilized through multiple interactions with industrial practices, technology, infrastructure, cultural codes, consumer practices, and administrative routines, meaning that effective unlocking requires coordinated pressure across these different dimensions [(Newig et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-10700-240118) [(Folke et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03610-150420). However, transformation strategies must also address the deeper coordination failures and power dynamics that maintain lock-in situations. Key governance actors often become caught in lasting coordination failures prone to mutual defection strategies due to power dynamics and discursive-institutional inertia [(Mendez et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01258-0). Escaping these situations requires transformative policy designs that account for meso-level mechanisms such as discursive power and its role in non-decision-making, pragmatic inaction, and inefficient investment and infrastructure [(Mendez et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01258-0). Moving beyond institutional inertia in practice requires more longitudinal policy strategies, explicit focus on actors and capabilities, and connecting policy implementation more directly to transformation visions [(Moilanen et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.138938) [(Reinekoski et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1177/00380261221123186). This involves recognizing that institutional inertia provides a useful middle-level concept for analyzing points of friction in socio-technical systems, offering a more nuanced and evolutionary view of how actors actively participate in reconfiguring obstacles and adjusting established regimes to meet changing expectations [(Moilanen et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.138938). The transformation approach must be systemic, recognizing that the capacity to transform at smaller scales draws on resilience from multiple scales, making use of crises as windows of opportunity for novelty and innovation, and recombining sources of experience and knowledge to navigate social-ecological transitions [(Folke et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03610-150420). This multi-scale perspective is crucial because transformational change at smaller scales enables resilience at larger scales, creating pathways for broader system transformation.
