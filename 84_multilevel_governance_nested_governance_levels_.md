## Background and Theoretical Foundations

**Summary:** Multi-level governance is a framework for understanding how policy authority and implementation are shared across different territorial levels (supranational, national, regional, local) and among various actors through both vertical and horizontal coordination mechanisms. Originally developed to analyze European Union policy-making, this approach recognizes that effective governance requires continuous negotiation and cooperation between nested levels of government rather than traditional top-down hierarchical control. (6 sources)

Multi-level governance (MLG) emerged as a theoretical framework to understand the complex allocation of power and authority across different territorial and administrative levels. The concept was first introduced by Marks in the context of EU structural policy reforms in 1988, defining it as "a system of continuous negotiation among nested governments at several territorial tiers-supranational, national, regional, and local-as the result of a broad process of institutional creation and decisional re-allocation" [(Cucca et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1177/10780874211041710). The OECD has provided a comprehensive definition of multi-level governance as "the explicit or implicit sharing of policy making authority, responsibility, development, and implementation at different administrative and territorial levels" across three key dimensions: horizontally across ministries at central level, vertically between different layers of government, and horizontally across actors at sub-national levels [(Watson et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W11040663) [(Jetoo, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/W9010040). The framework recognizes two distinct types of multi-level governance arrangements. Type I represents a hierarchical approach that focuses on how competencies and authority are shared between different levels of government with general purpose jurisdiction [(Cucca et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1177/10780874211041710) [(Maganda, 2012)](https://doi.org/10.2458/V19I1.21718). Type II represents a polycentric model characterized by multiple overlapping and interconnected horizontal spheres of authority, involving the interaction of public and private actors across local, national, and supranational levels in specific policy processes [(Cucca et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1177/10780874211041710) [(Maganda, 2012)](https://doi.org/10.2458/V19I1.21718). Multi-level governance fundamentally differs from traditional hierarchical governance by involving multiple actors at various levels through both vertical and horizontal relationships, where each level maintains authority to create, implement, and even refuse policies imposed by higher authorities [(Suman et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.21512/JAS.V5I1.2060). However, research has identified significant limitations in MLG systems, including vertical coordination problems, increasing transaction costs that rise with the number of administrative levels and degree of subnational autonomy, and underestimated conditions needed for effective policy coordination [(Keskitalo et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3390/CLI4010007). The EU structure has particularly influenced governance arrangements by creating new institutional configurations and reconfiguring state structures through legislation such as directives that require enforcement at state level [(Keskitalo et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3390/CLI4010007).

## Types and Models of Multi-level Governance

**Summary:** Multi-level governance operates through two distinct models: Type I represents nested, hierarchical systems with non-overlapping jurisdictions at limited territorial levels (like federalism), while Type II involves flexible, task-specific arrangements with overlapping jurisdictions that can be created or modified as needed for particular policy functions. (9 sources)

The multi-level governance literature distinguishes between two fundamental types of governance arrangements that organize authority and coordination differently across territorial and functional dimensions. Type I multi-level governance represents a hierarchical approach that "involves a limited number of nested jurisdictional levels" based on federalism and involving "power sharing between the central government and a few levels of subnational governments" [(Novalia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21622671.2024.2336608). This model focuses "on the standing relationship between agencies of general purpose jurisdiction" where "membership is defined by territories with durable boundaries, that do not overlap at any level, e.g., national states, regional and local governments" [(Maganda, 2012)](https://doi.org/10.2458/V19I1.21718) [(Novalia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21622671.2024.2336608). Type I systems are characterized as "symmetrical systems with a small number of territorial levels, organised to ensure the consistent 'nesting' of geographical areas" that "look like a Russian doll" [(Newman et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1080/1523908X.2023.2297793) [(Blauberger et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2022.2140818). In contrast, Type II multi-level governance represents a more complex and flexible arrangement that "is understood as the interaction of public and private local, national, and supranational actors in specific policy processes" such as water distribution or economic development [(Maganda, 2012)](https://doi.org/10.2458/V19I1.21718). This model "defines task-specific jurisdictions with intersecting memberships and flexible designs" and "encompasses vast numbers of overlapping jurisdictions, diverse territorial scales, and specific functions" [(Blauberger et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2022.2140818) [(Yi et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11082390). Type II systems are "asymmetrical systems in which jurisdictions are created ad hoc, at various overlapping scales, to perform particular policy functions" [(Newman et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1080/1523908X.2023.2297793). The key distinction lies in how these models handle jurisdictional boundaries and functional specialization. While Type I maintains clear territorial hierarchies with "general purpose jurisdictions" that provide "a wide range of functions to their communities," Type II allows for more adaptive governance structures where "jurisdictions may overlap" and "focus is on task jurisdictions which may change should the need arise" [(Novalia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21622671.2024.2336608) [(Vukasovic et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-77407-7_20). Despite the hierarchical structure of Type I systems, research shows that "local governments and non-state actors are perceived to have an ability to significantly shape policy processes and implementation by 'bypassing' national governments" [(Klein et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.30722/anzjes.vol16.iss1/2.20008). Both types operate within the broader framework where "governance at different levels is mutually interactive, but is independent vertically or horizontally, which is different from the traditional bureaucratic hierarchy" [(Yi et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11082390) [(Paavola, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1002/EET.1698). This flexibility is particularly important for addressing complex multiscale problems, as "climate problems, for example, have both local and global causes and effects, and thus need to be addressed in interplay between local and global authorities" [(Termeer et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03798-150429).

## Coordination Mechanisms: Vertical and Horizontal Integration

**Summary:** Multi-level governance operates through two primary coordination mechanisms: vertical integration connects different territorial levels (local, regional, national, supranational) through top-down and bottom-up processes, while horizontal integration coordinates actors at the same governance level, including cross-sectoral collaboration between public and private entities. When these mechanisms combine across levels, they create diagonal integration that enables comprehensive policy coordination. (10 sources)

Multi-level governance systems function through distinct coordination mechanisms that organize relationships both within and across different levels of authority. The framework encompasses three primary dimensions of interaction: "across different ministries and/or public agencies at the central government level (upper horizontally), between different layers of government at local, regional, national and supranational levels (vertically) and across different actors at subnational level (lower horizontally)" [(Gargano, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13169123). These coordination mechanisms enable the "dispersion of authority away from the central state upward to supranational institutions, downward to subnational institutions, and sideways to public-private networks" [(Riemsdijk, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/imig.13246) . **Vertical coordination** represents the core mechanism linking different territorial levels through both hierarchical and participatory processes. This dimension involves "the involvement of different levels of government" where "cities become particularly relevant whenever they go beyond the role of simple passive implementers and actively interact with national or regional policies" [(Garces-Mascarenas et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-020-0173-z). Vertical coordination operates through two directional flows: "top-down transitions, from national to lower levels, and bottom-up transitions, when local issues are bumped up to higher levels" [(Petrakis, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-47075-3_2) [(Cairney, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1057/S41293-017-0068-2). The top-down approach focuses on "central manipulative factors and on clear policies that need to be followed," while the bottom-up approach "emphasizes local-level policy and decision-making and networking techniques that identify local, regional, and national dimensions" [(Petrakis, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-47075-3_2). **Horizontal coordination** operates within the same governance level and "refers to the coordination between the actors, characteristic of sectoral policies, i.e., to the relations between public and private agents, or public agents among themselves" [(Dorado-Rubin et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land10101047). This mechanism involves "the involvement of non-governmental actors" and creates "complex, heterogeneous, and non-hierarchical networks" of actors [(Garces-Mascarenas et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-020-0173-z). Horizontal integration requires "appropriate cross-sectoral coordination so that they reconcile competing or complementary stakeholder interests, exploit diverse expertise, and develop holistic and integrated landscape-level policies and strategies" [(Schoneveld, 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3390/F6010088). **Diagonal integration** emerges as an advanced coordination mechanism that combines both vertical and horizontal dimensions. "When horizontal policy integration occurs not at a single level of governance, but is carried across vertical tiers of governance, one can also speak of diagonal policy integration" [(Pahl-Wostl et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-020-00888-6). This approach enables "integrated strategies require hybrid processes that take into account agents both at the same levels (horizontal) and at different levels (vertical)" [(Dorado-Rubin et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land10101047). The coordination process requires "continuous negotiation among nested governments at several territorial tiers" through a system that "focuses local needs while aligning them with national strategies and international frameworks" [(Kaur, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.47505/ijrss.2024.12.5) [(Keskitalo et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3390/CLI4010007). However, effective coordination faces significant challenges, as scholars "had underestimated the conditions needed to ensure effective policy co-ordination" including "vertical co-ordination problems, including increasing transaction costs, which rose with 'the number of administrative levels and degree of subnational autonomy'" [(Keskitalo et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3390/CLI4010007).

## Subsidiarity and Regional Differentiation

**Summary:** Subsidiarity is a foundational principle of multi-level governance that allocates decision-making authority to the lowest capable administrative level, enabling regional differentiation through customized policies that address local contexts while maintaining coordination across governance levels. This principle supports democratic legitimacy by ensuring decisions are made closest to the affected communities while allowing for territorial specialization based on regional strengths and needs. (8 sources)

The principle of subsidiarity serves as a fundamental organizing concept in multi-level governance systems, establishing how authority and responsibilities should be distributed across different territorial levels. Multi-level governance "can be defined as a continuous negotiation system between governments" where "the subsidiarity principle is in its basis; therefore, decisions are not only centered in one power level and inappropriate policies implemented at territorial and institutional level are avoided" [(Correia et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12208715). This principle ensures that governance functions are "allocated to the lowest capable administrative level" through "a networked partnership that assigns responsibilities based on the principle of subsidiarity" [(Song et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e34787). Subsidiarity operates as one of the "most significant principles of multi-level governance" alongside "transparency and openness of the process of development and adoption of political decisions" and "compliance with the principles of subsidiarity, inclusiveness and proportionality" [(2023)](https://doi.org/10.26565/1992-2337-2023-1-11). The principle "provides for the equality of different levels of power within the European Union, as well as their recognition of mutual democratic legitimacy" where "supranational, national and subnational levels of government should develop cooperation, which is carried out on a voluntary and mutually beneficial basis" [(2023)](https://doi.org/10.26565/1992-2337-2023-1-11). Regional differentiation emerges as a natural outcome of subsidiarity implementation, enabling territories to customize governance approaches based on local conditions and capabilities. The decentralization process grants "subnational authorities closer proximity, contextual expertise, and implementation mandates, empowering them with unique influence over the 'club goods' of innovation, such as industry-specific skills training, regional infrastructure projects, support structures for clusters, and tailored incentive mechanisms" [(Song et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e34787) [(Hu et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/en14237999) [(Kano et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13132-021-00879-7) [(Cajka et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.18522/2073-6606-2023-21-1-94-107). This approach to "regional innovation governance" emphasizes "the customization of innovation systems to the strengths and needs of specific territories, aligning with the principles of smart specialization" [(Song et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e34787). The subsidiarity principle enables effective territorial adaptation because "sub-national and local actors can more easily adapt innovations to the needs of local contexts, circumventing the limits on 'one-size for all' solutions" [(Nucci et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41358-021-00306-y). This flexibility supports the development of "integrated environmental protection frameworks and policies that integrate nature into market and planning activities and fit policies to specific regional conditions to harmonize social and economic development in line with environmental conditions and climate change" [(Tabara et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10010161). The effective implementation of subsidiarity requires balancing local autonomy with broader coordination needs. While national governments maintain "vital role in areas such as fundamental research, higher education, the development of large-scale infrastructure, funding for scientific endeavors, and maintaining macroeconomic stability," this "centralized control over public goods allows for nationwide coherence and the optimization of synergies between regions" [(Song et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e34787). The system promotes "democratic, fair and transparent governance" where "public participation is increased and political power is decentralized" through "collaborative and multi-level governance across scales and sectors" [(Tabara et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10010161).

## Agricultural and Food Policy Applications

**Summary:** Multi-level governance in agricultural and food policy requires coordination across supranational, national, regional, and local levels to address complex food system challenges, with municipalities increasingly driving sustainable food initiatives while facing coordination tensions with regional authorities and dependencies on higher-level funding and competencies. (2 sources)

Agricultural and food policy represents a critical application domain for multi-level governance approaches, requiring coordination across multiple territorial levels and policy sectors to address the complex, interconnected challenges of modern food systems. Multi-level governance efforts are essential to "develop integrated food policies that can mitigate negative trade-offs, while enhancing synergies between different sectors and policy fields" where governance includes "the collaborative efforts of networks of government agencies, societal stakeholders and private entities at and across (local, regional, national, supranational) governance levels" [(Boer et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2020.09.021). The European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) exemplifies supranational agricultural governance, with "policies towards territorial development and the sustainability of agro-food systems" primarily implemented through "Pillar II of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)" [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399746). However, while supranational frameworks provide overarching structure, "policies for the promotion of sustainable food systems and networks are mainly driven by municipalities and large cities" [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399746). This multi-level structure creates significant coordination challenges for agricultural policy implementation. Research identifies "three main axes of tension and discoordination—municipal Vs regional powers; agricultural vs. food policies; and rural vs. urban territories—that constrains the sustainability potential of multi-level agro food policies" [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399746). Municipal policymakers face particular constraints due to "the dependence of Local Authorities on supra-municipal funding and political competences" and call for "better cooperation and coordination among political scales" [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399746). To address these coordination challenges, food policy integration requires innovative institutional arrangements and policy instruments. "Food policy integration also raises the need for novel ways of using and combining policy instruments in policy mixes for food system transformation" with concrete examples including "the development of urban and regional Food Policy Councils (FPCs) that aim to integrate and develop holistic local food policies by fostering collaboration between a range of stakeholders" [(Boer et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2020.09.021). Practitioners advocate for "multi-level governance processes and tools for the better deployment of the sustainability potential of agri-food policies" through "integrative frameworks, such as 'health' and 'sustainability' policies, in order to enable multi-actor and multi-level governance" [(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1399746). Effective agricultural and food policy governance requires "a systemic approach that takes into account multiple actors, governance levels" to "better understand the technological, biophysical, political, economic and social dimensions of the dynamics that shape food systems and to identify the leverage points where intervention will be most effective" [(Boer et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2020.09.021).

## Implementation Challenges and Policy Scalability

**Summary:** Multi-level governance implementation faces significant challenges including coordination gaps between policy levels, misalignment between local needs and national strategies, and complex resource allocation across nested jurisdictions. Policy scalability requires fluid coordination mechanisms that can adapt through iterative processes while managing the tension between standardized approaches and territorial differentiation. (13 sources)

Multi-level governance systems encounter fundamental implementation challenges that stem from the complex interactions between different territorial levels and the need to coordinate diverse actors with varying interests and capabilities. The European Union's multi-level governance model demonstrates how "decision making competence is shared" where "policy-making at EU level involves in the loss of control for individual governments" while "Member states' competence has been transformed to the sub-national level-regional and local authority" [(Xu et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.4236/OJPS.2014.44022). This redistribution creates situations where "Actors at the sub-national as well as transnational level can by pass the national level on crucial issues" [(Xu et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.4236/OJPS.2014.44022). **Coordination Complexity and Resource Allocation** Implementation challenges arise from the inherent complexity of coordinating across multiple governance levels with different priorities and capabilities. The "interaction among governance systems at these three levels represents a complex tension among stakeholders at multiple levels" where "individual systems of governance influence each other, and the coordination among them is another key factor in considering the sustainability of holistic systems" [(Matsuura et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-4-431-54895-9_3). These coordination challenges are compounded by the fact that "vertical coordination of climate change-related policies and programs does not necessarily follow a strict top-down and ordered process; it is as likely to be top-down as bottom-up, or could evolve through an interactive and iterative process among different institutional levels" [(Nagel et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.4000/irpp.1123) [(Termeer et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03798-150429). Policy integration across domains requires that "policymakers align their policy goals, create dialogue, and share information about their preferred approaches and instruments" which "requires shared agreement on accountability and resource allocation; key components of multi-level governance approaches" [(Becken et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10941665.2025.2454238). However, "sustainability issues in SCD projects often require cooperation beyond a single municipality's scope, revealing the need for better horizontal and vertical coordination" [(Beckers et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10630732.2025.2461983) [(Termeer et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03798-150429). **Policy Mismatch and Local Adaptation** A critical implementation challenge involves the mismatch between standardized policies and local contexts. "National policies might overlook local needs" and "national SCD strategies may conflict with local goals" [(Beckers et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10630732.2025.2461983) [(Capurro et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1108/bpmj-01-2021-0052) [(Reardon et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21622671.2022.2107559). To address these challenges, practitioners must work within "boundary zones: transitional areas in which different regulatory frameworks on SCD are required to coexist and where exchange of organizational resources take place" where "interactions between multi-scalar and cross-jurisdictional regulatory frameworks can be observed to identify friction or harmonized coordination" [(Beckers et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10630732.2025.2461983) [(Reardon et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21622671.2022.2107559). **Scalability Through Learning and Reinforcement Mechanisms** Despite implementation challenges, multi-level governance systems demonstrate scalability potential through learning and reinforcement mechanisms. "Multi-level governance-from the global to the local level-can be regarded as a general mechanism of reinforcement" where "innovation take place at different parts of the governance system" and "can be adopted in other parts of the system" through "Lesson-drawing (peer-to-peer learning) from pioneers" and "Horizontal up-scaling of de-central innovations and best practice" [(Janicke, 2015)](https://doi.org/10.3390/EN8065782). The Paris Agreement exemplifies how modern governance approaches combine "bottom-up with top-down elements" through "Interactive learning and experimentation at different levels of global governance" where "Horizontal peer-to-peer learning between countries, cities and regions, as well as vertical up-scaling of best practice, has created a dynamic of change" [(Saerbeck et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1002/EET.1746). Success in multi-level integration requires that "climate action strategies of local governments are integrated with the different activities and/or strategies at the national or sub-national levels of government" to create "consistency and coherence in the formulation of policies and regulations, better facilitating the implementation of plans" [(Linton et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13010154). **Embedding and Network Governance** Effective scalability requires "Embedding governance vertically, from within the city up to the regional and global levels, and horizontally, across sectors, cities and regions" to "help ensure that local sustainability improvements are not achieved at the cost of global sustainability" [(Krueger et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42949-022-00053-1) [(Termeer et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03798-150429) [(Vogel, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1177/1086026619842517). This embedding process is facilitated through networks where "local initiatives and authorities collaborate with state, business, non-governmental, and academic actors and organizations at the local, sub-national, national, and European scale" [(Krueger et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42949-022-00053-1).
