**Research Query:** 7.3 What are the success factors for Payment for Ecosystem Services programs that achieved widespread farmer adoption in European agriculture?

---

## Background

**Summary:** Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) programs have emerged as a promising approach to bridge farmer interests with conservation goals, with the EU's Common Agricultural Policy increasingly focusing on results-based payments rather than blanket per-hectare subsidies. These programs compensate farmers for delivering measurable environmental benefits like biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration. (5 sources)

Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) programs represent a direct conservation approach that explicitly seeks to bridge the interests of landowners and outsiders by compensating farmers for environmental benefits [(Adisa et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.30574/wjarr.2024.21.1.0322) [(Wunder, 2005)](https://doi.org/10.17528/CIFOR/001760). These programs have demonstrated success in promoting sustainable land management practices, particularly by compensating farmers for preserving biodiversity or sequestering carbon, though they face challenges in clearly quantifying ecosystem services and addressing equity concerns in payment distribution [(Adisa et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.30574/wjarr.2024.21.1.0322). The European Union has increasingly embraced this approach, with the Common Agricultural Policy (2021-2027) allocating a 350 billion € budget that includes new agro-environmental measures under Pillar 2 that focus on payment for achieving specifically measured ecosystem services rather than bland payments per hectare or for practices not linked to delivering such services [(Bouma et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems5030056). In response to the limitations of traditional action-based agri-environmental schemes, targeted results-based programs that engage farmers in decision-making have emerged as successful solutions, using ecological scorecards to measure effectiveness and provide scalable financial rewards for biodiversity improvements [(Gorman et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-024-12845-2) [(Moran et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-12180-260120). Following successes of projects like Burren-LIFE and Results-Based Agri-environment Payment Schemes across Europe, these results-based approaches have seen widespread adoption through the Agricultural European Innovation Partnerships, particularly in Ireland [(Gorman et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-024-12845-2).

## Financial Incentives and Payment Design

**Summary:** Successful PES programs in European agriculture rely on results-based payment systems that reward farmers for measurable environmental outcomes rather than blanket per-hectare payments, combined with sufficient payment levels and flexible scoring systems that provide scalable financial rewards for biodiversity improvements. (6 sources)

The design of financial incentives represents a critical success factor for PES program adoption, with results-based payments emerging as particularly effective instruments that build on farm management decisions known to foster biodiversity or ecosystem services [(Lomba et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1002/FEE.2116). These innovative payment structures create markets for high nature value public goods and are seen as effective ways of increasing efficient use of public funds for sustainability goals, offering a pathway to ensuring the viability of valuable farmlands through rewards for the wide range of values delivered to society [(Lomba et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1002/FEE.2116). Results-based payment systems employ field scoring mechanisms that generate data to help determine where positive environmental impacts are occurring, providing scalable financial rewards for biodiversity improvements rather than simply offsetting potential losses [(Mcdonagh, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14095569) [(Gorman et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-024-12845-2) [(Moran et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-12180-260120). The numerical scoring advantage in these systems allows for single-site surveys to be repeated yearly and rewards ongoing improvements in site scores, making them a major component of modern agri-environmental schemes [(Gorman et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-024-12845-2) [(Moran et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-12180-260120). Payment adequacy also plays a crucial role in program success, with research suggesting that programs with sufficient levels of payment may attract participation among farmers to enhance ecosystem services [(White et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.2489/jswc.2022.00041). However, successful programs must balance multiple objectives, as farmers express desire for programs that both achieve additionality and reward existing stewards - goals that can be potentially at odds [(White et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.2489/jswc.2022.00041). Beyond financial considerations, the ability to maintain farmers' income levels and finance technological changes serves as an important element, though not necessarily the primary driver of program success [(Diaz et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.13189/EER.2017.050605).

## Program Flexibility and Farmer Autonomy

**Summary:** Successful PES programs provide farmers with flexibility to adapt schemes to their local conditions and farm types, while allowing them to use their knowledge and experience to decide how best to manage their land for environmental outcomes. This approach moves away from rigid "one-size-fits-all" policies toward location-specific solutions that incorporate farmer expertise. (3 sources)

Program flexibility emerges as a key success factor, with the simplicity of schemes and their compatibility with local farm types, activities, and farmer values, beliefs and norms serving as important reasons for program popularity [(Coyne et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.105174). This flexibility becomes particularly important when designing agri-environment options for farmers, given the heterogeneity in agriculture generally and within specific industries [(Coyne et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.105174). Results-based payment systems have gained support specifically because they allow farmers greater freedom to decide how to manage their land and use their skill and experience to improve environmental and agricultural performance [(Mcdonagh, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14095569). This approach can encourage the establishment of common goals between farmers and conservationists by paying farmers for outcomes rather than for performing set management activities [(Kovacs-Hostyanszki et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12762). The shift toward flexible, results-oriented programs challenges the traditional "one-size-fits-all" approach favored in EU policy, instead taking into account location-specific needs and challenges [(Mcdonagh, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14095569). This approach demands flexibility and adaptability while drawing on and incorporating farmer and local knowledge into program design and development [(Mcdonagh, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14095569). Successful programs create space where farmer knowledge and expertise have due prominence and where they receive recognized input in scheme development, combining top-down and bottom-up forces with locally led decision-making to enable landscapes to be both farmed and protected [(Mcdonagh, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14095569). Future schemes must consider factors that affect uptake including flexibility, how payment is offered, seasonality, fit with farm geography and management planning, and critically, lowering administrative burden for farmers [(Coyne et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.105174).

## Trust, Communication, and Social Networks

**Summary:** Building trust through locally-based intermediary institutions and effective communication networks is essential for PES program success, while leveraging farmer social networks and peer influence can significantly boost adoption rates among agricultural communities. (3 sources)

Trust-building emerges as a fundamental condition for PES program success, particularly through the creation of intermediary institutions that are locally based and led by program champions sympathetic to farmers' interests [(Diaz et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.13189/EER.2017.050605). These trusted intermediaries play a critical role in substituting old technical and social support networks with new ones that can effectively bridge the gap between conservation goals and farmer needs [(Diaz et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.13189/EER.2017.050605). Communication strategies prove equally important for program effectiveness, with regular dissemination of program rules and adoption rates through meetings and reports in agricultural magazines serving to make agri-environmental schemes more effective [(Banerjee et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10640-020-00529-7). This communication approach not only reduces scheme expenditure but also creates norm effects and allows farmers to accumulate experience in scheme management, ultimately increasing ecological results [(Banerjee et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10640-020-00529-7). Social networks within farming communities represent a powerful driver of program adoption, as the opinions of fellow farmers and the farming community play a crucial role in influencing farmers' decisions to participate in results-based schemes [(Eichhorn et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2024.2364774). Successful implementation strategies actively promote programs within these farmer social networks to boost adoption rates, recognizing that peer influence can be more persuasive than external promotion efforts [(Eichhorn et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2024.2364774).

## Knowledge Support and Capacity Building

**Summary:** Successful PES programs require comprehensive knowledge support systems that combine context-specific technical information from trusted sources with training and advice for farmers, particularly during introductory phases. These programs must incorporate farmer expertise into scheme design while providing capacity-building opportunities for both farmers and advisors. (4 sources)

Knowledge support emerges as a critical enabler for PES program success, with the delivery of context-specific information on how management changes impact ecosystem service performance from trusted sources serving to enhance farmers' decisions and aptly complement payment systems [(White et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.2489/jswc.2022.00041). This knowledge transfer becomes particularly important given that self-efficacy plays a significant role in farmer adoption decisions, making actions to enhance farmers' ability to implement schemes through knowledge support, training, and advice especially crucial during the introductory phase of programs [(Eichhorn et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2024.2364774). Capacity building extends beyond individual farmer training to encompass broader knowledge-sharing and capacity-building programs for both farmers and advisors, which serve as essential components of successful PES implementation strategies [(Lomba et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1002/FEE.2116). These programs recognize that effective results-based payment systems require farmers to have the skills and knowledge necessary to use their experience to improve both environmental and agricultural performance [(Mcdonagh, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14095569). The integration of farmer knowledge into program design represents a fundamental aspect of successful capacity building approaches. Research identifies the importance of creating spaces where farmer knowledge and expertise have due prominence and where farmers receive recognized input in scheme development, combining top-down and bottom-up forces with locally led decision-making to enable landscapes to be both farmed and protected [(Mcdonagh, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14095569). This approach draws on and incorporates farmer and local knowledge into program design and development, moving away from standardized solutions toward location-specific approaches that build on existing farmer expertise [(Mcdonagh, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14095569).

## Administrative Burden and Simplicity

**Summary:** Reducing administrative complexity and burden for farmers is a critical success factor for PES programs, with simple schemes that fit well with existing farm management planning and geography showing higher adoption rates. Clear communication of program rules through accessible channels helps reduce administrative costs while improving ecological outcomes. (2 sources)

Administrative burden reduction emerges as a critical factor determining PES program success, with the simplicity of schemes serving as an important reason for their popularity among farmers [(Coyne et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.105174). Future schemes must take into consideration factors that affect uptake including flexibility, how remuneration is offered, seasonality, goodness of fit with farm geography and management planning, and critically, lowering administrative burden for farmers engaging with these schemes [(Coyne et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.105174). The simplicity of program design becomes particularly important when considering the compatibility with local farm types and activities, as well as alignment with farmer values, beliefs and norms [(Coyne et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.105174). This compatibility reduces the administrative complexity that farmers must navigate when participating in PES programs. Clear communication of program rules represents another key element in reducing administrative burden and improving program effectiveness. Communication of program rules and adoption rates through meetings and reports in agricultural magazines can make agri-environmental schemes more effective, not only reducing scheme expenditure but also creating norm effects and allowing farmers to accumulate experience in scheme management, which ultimately increases ecological results [(Banerjee et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10640-020-00529-7).
