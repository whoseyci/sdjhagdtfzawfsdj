## Introduction

**Summary:** Benefit transfer is a widely used economic valuation method that applies ecosystem service values from previously studied locations to new policy sites, offering a cost-effective alternative to primary valuation studies. While popular for valuing agricultural and biodiversity services like pollination and pest control, the method requires careful application due to challenges with data availability, spatial variation, and transferability assumptions. (17 sources)

Benefit transfer methodology represents a fundamental approach in environmental economics that estimates the economic value of ecosystem services by transferring estimates from previously studied locations (study sites) to new locations where valuation is needed (policy sites) [(Brander et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2024.101606) [(Jiang et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11769-015-0790-x). This approach has emerged as a practical solution to the significant cost and time constraints associated with conducting primary economic valuation studies [(Nicolette et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU5052152) [(Nicolette et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.1020334) [(Agaton et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/earth4010006). The widespread adoption of benefit transfer stems from its ability to provide rapid, cost-effective assessments of ecosystem service values when primary data collection is not feasible [(Temesgen et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10041126) [(Silva et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.ECOSER.2014.07.008) [(Rizal et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.13057/BIODIV/D180218). The method has gained particular prominence in policy contexts where decision-makers require timely economic information about environmental impacts and benefits [(Undi et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5772/59899) [(Perez-Blanco et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021WR030478). Benefit transfer has been extensively applied to value agricultural ecosystem services, including pollination, natural pest control, and other biodiversity-related services that are often underpriced or unpriced by conventional markets [(Metz et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rala.2019.07.005). The method's utility extends across multiple ecosystem types and services, from water regulation and soil formation to wildlife habitat and recreation [(Undi et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5772/59899) [(Najmuddin et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land11111906) [(Deng et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/907367). The theoretical foundation of benefit transfer rests on the premise that ecosystem service values can be meaningfully transferred between locations with similar ecological, social, and economic characteristics [(Sandhu et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/acadf4) [(Gravitiani et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.24269/ekuilibrium.v15i2.2787). However, the method's reliability depends critically on the availability of high-quality primary studies and the similarity between study and policy sites [(Mehvar et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/JMSE6010005) [(O'Higgins et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03585-150407).

## Types and Approaches of Benefit Transfer

**Summary:** Benefit transfer methods fall into two main categories: unit value transfer (using single values from existing studies) and benefit function transfer (using statistical models from multiple studies). Meta-analytic function transfer generally produces the most reliable results with lower transfer errors compared to simple unit value approaches. (5 sources)

The benefit transfer methodology encompasses several distinct approaches that vary in complexity and accuracy. The primary classification divides benefit transfer into two main categories with specific variations within each [(Vackar et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3897/ONEECO.3.E25508): ## Unit Value Transfer Methods **Simple Unit Value Transfer**: This basic approach uses a single, unadjusted ecosystem service value from an existing study and applies it directly to the policy site [(Jiang et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11769-015-0790-x) [(Vackar et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3897/ONEECO.3.E25508). This method represents the most straightforward application of benefit transfer but offers limited customization for site-specific conditions. **Adjusted Unit Value Transfer**: This approach modifies the transferred values to account for differences between study and policy sites, typically adjusting for factors such as currency values, income levels, population, and other socioeconomic variables [(Nicolette et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU5052152) [(Vackar et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3897/ONEECO.3.E25508). The adjustments help improve the relevance of transferred values to local conditions. ## Benefit Function Transfer Methods **Single-Site Benefit Function Transfer**: This method employs an estimated valuation function derived from a single primary study and applies it to the policy site [(Eric et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11273-022-09857-5) [(Vackar et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3897/ONEECO.3.E25508). The function incorporates explanatory variables that can be adjusted based on site-specific characteristics. **Meta-Analytic Function Transfer**: This approach uses statistical models (meta-regression) to synthesize environmental resource values from multiple primary studies, describing how values change with study characteristics [(Jiang et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11769-015-0790-x) [(Eric et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11273-022-09857-5) [(Brander et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10640-011-9535-1). Research demonstrates that meta-regression benefit transfers produce lower transfer errors and generate more reliable values compared to unit value methods [(Eric et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11273-022-09857-5). The meta-analytic approach has shown particular promise, with studies reporting significantly lower prediction errors (66-185% absolute percentage errors) compared to unit value transfer methods [(Eric et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11273-022-09857-5). The method incorporates spatial variables, GDP per capita, population density, and ecosystem-specific characteristics to produce more accurate valuations [(Brander et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10640-011-9535-1).

## Application to Agricultural and Biodiversity Valuation

**Summary:** Benefit transfer has become a key method for valuing agricultural ecosystem services like pollination, pest control, and biodiversity conservation. The approach is particularly useful for assessing underpriced or unpriced services in agricultural systems, though it requires careful consideration of spatial and temporal variability in ecological and economic conditions. (9 sources)

Benefit transfer methodology has found extensive application in valuing agricultural ecosystem services that are typically underpriced or unpriced by conventional markets. Agricultural lands provide numerous ecosystem services including flood mitigation, pollination, wildlife habitat and biodiversity, carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, aesthetics, and recreation [(Metz et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rala.2019.07.005). The method has been frequently applied to value indirect use benefits such as air pollution regulation, biodiversity improvement, soil fertility, soil erosion control, temperature control, positive health effects, recreation, and stormwater control [(Wainaina et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land9110465). The practical applications of benefit transfer in agricultural contexts demonstrate its versatility across different scales and ecosystems. Remote sensing combined with benefit transfer has been extensively employed to assess ecosystem services across various locations and scales, facilitating the transfer of results from existing valuation studies to areas with comparable ecosystems and beneficiaries while significantly reducing time and costs [(Palafox-Juarez et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.18954) [(Fernandez-Diaz et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.898904) [(Wong et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12389). This approach has been used to estimate the economic value of ecosystem services lost due to land-use changes through unit value transfer analysis, incorporating methodologies from The Economics of Ecosystems & Biodiversity [(Palafox-Juarez et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.18954). For specific agricultural pest control services, benefit transfer has been applied to quantify services provided by natural predators in agroecosystems. Research has demonstrated the development of compound spatial-temporal models that incorporate spatial and temporal variability in crop pest-control service values, showing greater accuracy than simple spatial or temporal models [(Wiederholt et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21513732.2016.1240712). This work highlights that ecosystem services in agricultural systems can vary spatially due to multiple factors including insecticide use, technology adoption rates, economic forces, and environmental factors such as soils and climate [(Wiederholt et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21513732.2016.1240712) [(Spangenberg et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21513732.2014.884166). However, the application of benefit transfer to agricultural and biodiversity valuation requires careful attention to ecological similarity between study and policy sites. There is a critical need to ensure that ecological conditions are comparable between locations; otherwise, the transferred values may be overstated or understated [(Wainaina et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land9110465). The reliability of benefit transfer depends on controlling for factors such as valuation methods, presence of beneficiaries, level of service supply, timing of analysis, and contextual variables describing the socioecological system that vary across space [(Carrasco et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2001657) [(Grimsrud et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.4324/9781351002080-5).

## Spatial Considerations and Geographic Information Systems

**Summary:** Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology has become essential for spatially explicit benefit transfer, enabling the incorporation of socio-economic and environmental characteristics to improve valuation accuracy. However, spatial heterogeneity in ecosystem service values and willingness to pay creates significant challenges that simple distance decay models often fail to capture adequately. (6 sources)

The integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology has revolutionized benefit transfer applications by facilitating the incorporation of socio-economic and environmental characteristics that affect land values into spatially explicit models [(Boutwell et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.3390/RESOURCES2040517). GIS enables the analysis of data describing land, ecosystems, populations, economies and discrete points that do not share boundaries or jurisdictions, allowing for a spatially explicit mosaic-like representation of ecosystem values [(Boutwell et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.3390/RESOURCES2040517). The typical GIS-based benefit transfer process involves defining the geographic extent of study, determining spatial ecosystem classification based on service flow characteristics, performing meta-analysis to establish effects of characteristics on estimated values, and applying the resulting valuation function to land typology datasets that distinguish between ecosystem types while incorporating other variables such as income and substitutes [(Boutwell et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.3390/RESOURCES2040517). Benefits transfer spatializes ecosystem service values by linking attributes to mapped landscape units, typically using land use/land cover classifications [(Andrew et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2015.1033809). However, significant challenges arise from spatial heterogeneity that conventional approaches often fail to address adequately. A major shortcoming identified with benefits transfer is generalization error, which results from assumptions that ecosystem service levels and values are constant within mapped classes and that estimates are representative across space [(Andrew et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2015.1033809). The use of categorical information to represent features that vary continuously in space and time may produce inaccurate spatial representations [(Andrew et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2015.1033809). Research demonstrates that estimation errors resulting from assuming homogeneity within markets are larger than errors from methodological concerns that are addressed more frequently by resource economists [(Boutwell et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.3390/RESOURCES2040517). Spatial heterogeneity in willingness to pay is considerable between rural and urban landscapes and between regions, with these trends often obscured by traditional distance decay accounting [(Boutwell et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.3390/RESOURCES2040517). Hot spots for willingness to pay for environmental improvements can occur distant from the resource, and simple decay functions fail to accurately represent the true distribution of willingness to pay [(Boutwell et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.3390/RESOURCES2040517). To address these challenges, benefit transfer methods must account for spatial variability through statistical spatial metamodels that control for valuation methods, presence of beneficiaries, service supply levels, timing of analysis, and contextual variables describing socioecological systems that vary across space [(Carrasco et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2001657) [(Grimsrud et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.4324/9781351002080-5). Advanced approaches, such as compound spatial-temporal models that incorporate both spatial and temporal variability in ecosystem service values, demonstrate greater accuracy than simple spatial or temporal models [(Wiederholt et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21513732.2016.1240712). The scale of analysis presents additional considerations, as spatially explicit ecosystem service studies have typically been conducted at coarse spatial scales covering large geographic areas, while most land-development and resource-management decisions require information at much finer local scales [(O'Higgins et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03585-150407).

## Validity, Transferability, and Assumptions

**Summary:** The validity of benefit transfer depends on the similarity between study and policy sites, the quality of original studies, and the appropriateness of transferability assumptions. Transfer errors arise from generalization problems, sampling limitations, and the inherent challenge that all valuation contexts have unique characteristics that cannot be fully captured by existing models. (9 sources)

The validity and reliability of benefit transfer methodology fundamentally depends on the degree of similarity between study and policy sites across multiple dimensions. A legitimate use of benefit transfer should meet several critical conditions: the populations of both regions should be similar, goods and services in all locations should have about the same characteristics, and initial estimated values should be current because preferences change over time [(Undi et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5772/59899). The method is more reliable when the original site and the site object of the transfer are similar in quality, location, and population characteristics, when the environmental changes are similar, and when the original study was soundly realized and used appropriate economic valuation methodologies [(Dung et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.54609/reaser.v23i1.115). However, the applicability of benefit transfer depends exclusively upon the two sites being tolerably similar, a requirement that has often been challenging and is seriously debated in the literature on ecological economics [(Temesgen et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10041126). The limitations include the availability, reliability, and distribution of data on services and values across ecosystems, and variation in socioeconomic and geographic settings [(Temesgen et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10041126). **Sources of Transfer Error** Validity is fundamentally linked to the error generated during the benefit transfer process, with generalization error identified as the main source of errors in this methodology [(Diaz-Pinzon et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14148302). Three primary types of error have been identified: - **Uniformity error** occurs when it is assumed that the value of an ecosystem service is constant regardless of the land cover being analyzed - **Sampling error** occurs with bias in the selection of source studies, since the availability of studies is sometimes very limited with few measurements - **Regionalization error** occurs when small study areas are taken as reference, which may not be representative for extrapolation to a wider region [(Diaz-Pinzon et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14148302) **Fundamental Limitations** All benefit transfer methods are constrained in terms of their capacity to account for unique attributes of particular policy sites [(Johnston et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1017/age.2019.22) [(Bateman et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.1007/S10640-010-9418-X). All valuation contexts are characterized by unique conditions, including ecosystem services, substitutes and complements, populations, geospatial dimensions, and other factors that influence economic values [(Johnston et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1017/age.2019.22). Although meta-regression models can provide means to adjust willingness-to-pay predictions for some of these factors, their ability to do so is limited by the set of variables in the model and the information available from primary valuation studies [(Johnston et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1017/age.2019.22). **Quality and Reliability Concerns** The maximum accuracy and reliability attributable to the benefit transfer method are those of the original study [(Dung et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.54609/reaser.v23i1.115). Benefit transfer values are largely abstract and indicative, often relying on the availability of data and classifications developed for other purposes and not necessarily at an appropriate scale [(Nijnik et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3897/ONEECO.2.E14808). There is considerable confusion and controversy in the academic literature regarding the overall effectiveness of benefit transfer, as well as over what the optimal methods to employ are [(Hejnowicz et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU9050850). The reliability of benefits transfer is particularly challenging in areas where the paucity of data can lead to unreliable results, yet in the absence of site-specific primary studies, benefits transfer is commonly employed [(O'Higgins et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03585-150407). While benefit transfer can provide good approximations to areas that have not been previously studied if carefully crafted, persistent issues concerning valuation transfer practices should not be ignored but instead acknowledged and addressed to avoid undermining the integration of ecosystem service values into policymaking [(Hejnowicz et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU9050850).

## Limitations and Challenges

**Summary:** Benefit transfer faces significant methodological limitations including generalization errors, scale mismatches, and the fundamental challenge that all valuation contexts have unique characteristics that cannot be fully captured. While the method provides useful approximations when primary studies are unavailable, persistent quality and reliability issues require careful acknowledgment to avoid undermining ecosystem service integration into policymaking. (11 sources)

The implementation of benefit transfer methodology faces several fundamental limitations that constrain its accuracy and reliability across different applications. A primary concern is **generalization error**, identified as the main source of errors in benefit transfer methodology, which encompasses three distinct types of error [(Diaz-Pinzon et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14148302). **Uniformity error** occurs when it is assumed that the value of an ecosystem service is constant regardless of the land cover being analyzed, **sampling error** occurs with bias in the selection of source studies since the availability of studies is sometimes very limited with few measurements, and **regionalization error** occurs when small study areas are taken as reference, which may not be representative for extrapolation to a wider region [(Diaz-Pinzon et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14148302). The method's reliance on similarity assumptions creates significant practical challenges. The applicability of benefit transfer depends exclusively upon the two sites being tolerably similar, a requirement that has often been challenging and is seriously debated in the literature on ecological economics [(Temesgen et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10041126). These limitations include the availability, reliability, and distribution of data on services and values across ecosystems, and variation in socioeconomic and geographic settings [(Temesgen et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10041126). **Inherent Methodological Constraints** All benefit transfer methods are constrained in terms of their capacity to account for unique attributes of particular policy sites [(Johnston et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1017/age.2019.22) [(Bateman et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.1007/S10640-010-9418-X). All valuation contexts are characterized by unique conditions, including ecosystem services, substitutes and complements, populations, geospatial dimensions, and other factors that influence economic values [(Johnston et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1017/age.2019.22). Although meta-regression models can provide means to adjust willingness-to-pay predictions for some of these factors, their ability to do so is limited by the set of variables in the model and the information available from primary valuation studies [(Johnston et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1017/age.2019.22). **Scale and Spatial Resolution Issues** Spatially explicit ecosystem service studies have typically been conducted at coarse spatial scales covering large geographic areas, while most land-development and resource-management decisions require information at much finer local scales [(O'Higgins et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03585-150407). Benefits transfer spatializes ecosystem service values by linking attributes to mapped landscape units, but generalization error results from assumptions that the level and value of ecosystem service provisioning are constant within a mapped class [(Andrew et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2015.1033809). The use of categorical information to represent features that vary continuously in space and time may produce inaccurate spatial representations [(Andrew et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2015.1033809). **Data Quality and Availability Challenges** The reliability of benefits transfer is particularly challenging in areas where the paucity of data can lead to unreliable results, yet in the absence of site-specific primary studies, benefits transfer is commonly employed [(O'Higgins et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03585-150407). Benefit transfer values are largely abstract and indicative, often relying on the availability of data and classifications developed for other purposes and not necessarily at an appropriate scale . Benefits transfer are only as accurate as the initial study and only valid if conditions are similar at both sites, with care needed when extrapolating value estimates from one site or population to another [(Rizal et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.13057/BIODIV/D180218). **Agricultural System Complexities** In agricultural systems specifically, ecosystem services can vary spatially due to multiple factors including insecticide use, technology adoption rates, economic forces, and environmental factors such as soils and climate, making accurate evaluation of ecosystem services challenging [(Wiederholt et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21513732.2016.1240712) [(Spangenberg et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21513732.2014.884166). Simple benefit transfer approaches can be problematic in that they typically yield large error rates when there is a lack of correspondence in biophysical and socioeconomic factors when extrapolating ecosystem service values from one area to another [(Wiederholt et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21513732.2016.1240712). **Professional and Academic Concerns** There is considerable confusion and controversy in the academic literature regarding the overall effectiveness of benefit transfer, as well as over what the optimal methods to employ are [(Hejnowicz et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU9050850). While benefit transfer can provide good approximations to areas that have not been previously studied if carefully crafted, persistent issues concerning valuation transfer practices should not be ignored but instead acknowledged and addressed to avoid undermining the integration of ecosystem service values into policymaking [(Hejnowicz et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU9050850). Principal disadvantages are that values have to be transferred with a high degree of caution, applying conservative assumptions to address the context sensitivity of both the study and source value site, and that only a limited subset of relevant primary values may be available [(Silva et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.ECOSER.2014.07.008).
