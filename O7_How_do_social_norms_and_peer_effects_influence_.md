**Research Query:** O.7 How do social norms and peer effects influence farmer adoption of conservation practices in Mediterranean agricultural communities?

---

## Introduction

**Summary:** Social norms and peer effects play a crucial role in shaping farmer decisions about conservation practices in Mediterranean agricultural communities. These social influences can either accelerate or hinder the adoption of sustainable farming methods depending on community attitudes and network structures. (LLM Memory)

Social norms and peer effects are key drivers of agricultural decision-making in Mediterranean farming communities, where traditional practices often compete with modern conservation approaches . Farmers do not make adoption decisions in isolation but are heavily influenced by the attitudes, behaviors, and experiences of their social networks, including neighbors, family members, and other community members . In Mediterranean agricultural systems, where farming practices have deep cultural roots and economic constraints are common, social influence mechanisms become particularly important for understanding why some conservation practices spread rapidly while others face resistance . The strength of social ties, the credibility of information sources, and prevailing community attitudes toward innovation and environmental stewardship all shape individual farmer choices about adopting practices like soil conservation, water management, and integrated pest management . Understanding these social dynamics is essential for designing effective policies and extension programs that can leverage positive peer effects while addressing social barriers to conservation adoption .

## Mechanisms of Social Influence

**Summary:** Social influence operates through multiple mechanisms including information flow through trusted networks, social pressure from influential community members, and social learning where farmers observe and mimic successful practices of their peers. (12 sources)

Social influence on conservation practice adoption operates through several key mechanisms that shape farmer decision-making in Mediterranean agricultural communities. Information flows most effectively across trusted, diverse networks where social norms encourage innovation, while uptake remains limited in homogenous, close-knit farming communities with strong norms favoring the status quo [(Rust et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.35241/emeraldopenres.13412.1). Within farming communities, social norms and group pressure significantly impact agricultural producers' perceptions and attitudes, with influential farmers often serving as reference points when their successful experiences are shared [(Aznar-Sanchez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10040506). Family, friends, neighbors, and agricultural professionals such as vendors and technicians also exert pressure on farmer decision-making processes [(Aznar-Sanchez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10040506). Social pressure mechanisms are particularly strong among farmers who rely on existing social structures, as farmers are more likely to adopt new practices when most neighbors have done so, when they follow the opinions of 'important others' who support adoption, and when they seek to gain social status in their communities [(Buyinza et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5539/jsd.v15n3p68) [(Buyinza et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10549811.2020.1738948) [(Dessart et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ERAE/JBZ019). Social learning represents another crucial mechanism, operating through both cognitive learning from others and normative learning guided by community values, where interactions with other farmers can shift attitudes and lead to greater conservation practice adoption [(Teodoro et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2022.2135152) [(Huitema et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03260-150116). Social norms also shape communication and knowledge sharing patterns within communities, with norms that encourage open communication and collaboration increasing farmers' willingness to learn from one another and share adoption experiences [(Ruslan et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.6007/ijarbss/v13-i6/16903). Social learning through direct observation and first-hand experience of how other farmers use conservation practices increases trust in new approaches and encourages adoption, particularly when farmers have access to social networks of like-minded individuals who value sustainable practices [(Gemtou et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su16072828) [(Schoonhoven et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2018.1537664) [(Blasch et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1093/erae/jbaa031). The influence of peer networks is so strong that farmers demonstrate high reliance on their peers through study groups, cooperation, and mere exposure to neighbors' behavior [(Milliet et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2023.102223).

## Types of Social Networks and Their Effects

**Summary:** Different types of social networks - including formal organizations, informal peer groups, family networks, and community associations - each have distinct effects on conservation adoption, with formal membership organizations showing particularly strong positive impacts on practice uptake. (8 sources)

Formal organizations such as farmers' associations, cooperative societies, and resource users' groups create structured environments for information exchange and belief harmonization that help farmers overcome resource constraints and adopt sustainable land management practices [(Zeweld et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10092963). Farmers who are members of formal organizations have a 6% higher probability of adopting two or more sustainable land management practices compared to non-members, demonstrating the strong influence of rural institutions and organized networks [(Zeweld et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10092963). These formal networks are particularly effective because training programs on sustainable agriculture practices are usually directed toward organized structures, and group membership facilitates the diffusion of new technologies and practices [(Yameogo et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SOCSCI7030033). Informal social networks, including neighbors, families, friends, and relatives, also play crucial roles in conservation adoption. Farmers with strong ties and relationships within these local community groups are 5-6% more likely to apply one or more agricultural practices than farmers with weaker social connections [(Zeweld et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10092963). Personal engagement in both formal and informal peer groups serves as an important precondition for farmers' willingness to uptake agri-environmental cropping practices [(Adamsone-Fiskovica et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1742170524000085). The influence of subjective norms from these networks - including perceived social influence through other farmers, the farming community, and surrounding networks - significantly affects farmers' perceived usefulness of conservation schemes and their participation in agricultural environmental programs [(Eichhorn et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2024.2364774) [(Blasch et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1093/erae/jbaa031) [(Venkatesh et al., 2000)](https://doi.org/10.1287/MNSC.46.2.186.11926). Social networks also serve as important conduits for information transfer and collective learning. Social groups, kinship networks, and friendship networks facilitate access to information about new varieties and conservation practices, allowing members to learn from peers' experiences and benefit from collective investments made by their groups [(Yameogo et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SOCSCI7030033). Visiting with other farmers to observe their practices was positively associated with farmers' intentions to increase their use of adaptive conservation strategies [(Roesch-McNally et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-016-9719-y). Additionally, membership in NGOs and community organizations helps farmers internalize the economic externalities of conservation practices, particularly important given that soil conservation benefits are often communal rather than individual [(Muhamud, 2015)](https://doi.org/10.22146/IJG.6743).

## Positive Effects of Social Norms on Adoption

**Summary:** Social norms create powerful positive drivers for conservation adoption through appreciation from neighbors, successful peer examples, and community support that reinforces sustainable practices. Farmers are more likely to adopt when they expect social approval and can observe successful implementation by respected community members. (13 sources)

Positive social norms significantly enhance conservation practice adoption by creating supportive environments where sustainable practices are valued and rewarded. Farmers who expect appreciation from their neighbors about adopting particular conservation practices are more likely to implement those practices [(Teklewold et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2018.1442801). Both injunctive norms (what the community approves) and descriptive norms (what other farmers actually do) positively influence adoption intentions, with these group norms explaining over 52% of farmers' intentions to adopt practices like mixed cropping [(Bonke et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-020-00653-0). The presence of other farmers who have already adopted specific practices leads to accurate information sharing and higher adoption intentions among their peers [(Bonke et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-020-00653-0) [(Dessart et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ERAE/JBZ019). Social approval and reputation effects create powerful incentives for conservation adoption. Social norms for biodiversity conservation exist among farming communities, and most farmers have preferences for following these social rules, with communication of adoption rates through meetings and agricultural publications making conservation schemes more effective [(Banerjee et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10640-020-00529-7) [(Dessart et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ERAE/JBZ019). Neighborhood effects demonstrate strong positive influence, as farmers are more likely to adopt practices like stream trenches, slope leveling, stone bunds, and farm ponds when their neighbors have adopted these same conservation measures [(Peddi et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.37773/ees.v4i2.273). The strength of positive social norms varies with network density and community support structures. Social norms have the strongest positive impact on conservation technology adoption among farmers with high social network connections compared to those with weaker networks, indicating that social networks can enhance the positive effects of community norms [(Ren et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1001442). When farmers feel support and acceptance from family, neighbors, and community members, this creates social norms that shape their perceptions of environmental sustainability and lead to higher adoption rates of climate-smart agriculture practices [(Nugraha et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/1323/1/012018). Subjective norms significantly influence adoption intentions, with social influence creating a "bandwagon effect" where peer behavior strongly motivates technology uptake [(Monteiro et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-04775-x) [(Nejadrezaei et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13201-018-0819-2) [(Canavari et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202012.0786.v1) [(Sun et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.901169). Well-respected farmers who successfully implement conservation practices serve as particularly influential role models, leading to rapid diffusion of practices throughout communities as other farmers follow their example [(Liu et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su10020432). This peer influence is reinforced when farmers have confidence in both researchers' suggestions and knowledge that their peers have also been convinced, significantly improving uptake of new conservation ideas [(Salvia et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE8060085).

## Barriers and Negative Effects

**Summary:** Social norms can create significant barriers to conservation adoption when communities favor traditional practices or when farmers perceive that others will benefit from their conservation efforts without contributing themselves. Close-knit communities with strong status quo norms particularly resist innovation. (5 sources)

Despite the positive effects of social influence, social norms and peer effects can also create substantial barriers to conservation practice adoption in Mediterranean agricultural communities. Traditional farming practices that are deeply rooted in cultural beliefs may be resistant to change, making it challenging to promote the adoption of sustainable agriculture practices [(Ruslan et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.6007/ijarbss/v13-i6/16903). Information flows are more limited in homogenous, close-knit farming communities that do not have many links with non-farmers and where there is a strong social norm to adhere to the status quo [(Rust et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.35241/emeraldopenres.13412.1). Free-rider concerns represent a particularly important barrier to conservation adoption. Farmers are less likely to adopt conservation tillage because they perceive that their adoption has beneficial effects that are captured by their neighbors and they experience disutility from the feeling that others free ride on their application of conservation practices [(Teklewold et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2018.1442801). This problem occurs because not all the benefits accrue to the individual who adopts the practice, leading farmers to forgo agricultural investments to prevent others from benefiting without contributing [(Teklewold et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2018.1442801) [(Liu et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su10020432). Social norms can also discourage knowledge sharing and communication within communities. If social norms discourage open communication and collaboration, farmers may be less likely to share their experiences or seek advice from others, leading to slower adoption of sustainable agriculture practices [(Ruslan et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.6007/ijarbss/v13-i6/16903) [(Olawuyi, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/23311886.2019.1588447). Additionally, social conformity pressures can work against innovation, as late adopters face more pressure from the community and their peers to maintain traditional practices, while early adopters are more driven by financial incentives and regulation [(Liu et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su10020432).

## Implications for Policy and Extension

**Summary:** Policy makers and extension services can leverage social influence by targeting social networks, using peer-to-peer learning programs, communicating adoption rates locally, and building community support structures that reinforce positive norms around conservation practices. (9 sources)

Understanding the powerful role of social norms and peer effects in conservation adoption creates important opportunities for more effective policy design and extension approaches. Extension and outreach efforts can leverage spatial peer networks to increase awareness about the costs and benefits of conservation practices, using targeted information campaigns that inform farmers about local adoption rates and environmental benefits to effectively induce behavioral changes in neighborhood networks [(Kolady et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1017/aae.2020.24). Policy makers should consider engaging local leaders, influential farmers, and farmer associations to promote conservation technologies, as subjective norms significantly influence adoption intentions and create "bandwagon effects" where peer behavior strongly motivates technology uptake [(Monteiro et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-04775-x) [(Nejadrezaei et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13201-018-0819-2) [(Sun et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.901169). The introduction of voluntary agri-environmental schemes can encourage adoption, and considering positive effects of group norms within policy schemes could further increase adoption on a large scale, particularly since both injunctive and descriptive group norms explain over 52% of farmers' intention to adopt practices like mixed cropping [(Bonke et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-020-00653-0). Communication of social norms and adoption rates through meetings and reports in agricultural magazines can make agri-environmental schemes more effective, as social norms for biodiversity conservation exist among farming communities and most farmers have preferences for following these social rules [(Banerjee et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10640-020-00529-7). Promoting peer-to-peer learning has proven effective in enhancing farmer willingness to try new management approaches, and better integration of conservation awards with opportunities for peer recognition among farmers represents a promising approach to expand implementation of conservation practices [(Schattman et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1525/ELEMENTA.2021.00120). Extension programs should focus on building support and positive social norms among farming communities rather than targeting only individual farmers, since support from family, neighbors, and community creates social norms that shape farmers' perceptions of environmental sustainability [(Nugraha et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/1323/1/012018). This requires collaboration between families, farmer organizations, government institutions, and local communities to support transitions to more sustainable agricultural practices, as exposure to new relationships, ideas, and technologies can lead farmers to reconstruct their mental conceptions and develop new identities as conservationist farmers [(McGuire et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-012-9381-y).
