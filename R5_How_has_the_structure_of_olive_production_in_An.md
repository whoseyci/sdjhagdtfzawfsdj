## Background on CAP Reforms and Policy Framework

**Summary:** Spain's 1986 EU accession brought CAP subsidies that made olive farming highly profitable, leading to major policy reforms in 1998 and 2003 that shifted from production-based support to sustainability-focused incentives. These reforms drove technological innovation, irrigation expansion, and intensification while later encouraging organic production methods. (4 sources)

Spain's entry into the European Union in 1986 marked a transformative moment for Andalusian olive production, as it allowed Spanish olive growers to benefit from the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidies that made olive farming significantly more profitable than other agricultural activities [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12114398). The CAP framework underwent two major reform periods that fundamentally shaped the sector's development. The 1998 CAP reform, initially planned from 1998 to 2001 and extended until 2004, supported both products and producers through market-based policies while simultaneously improving production systems and infrastructure through structural policies [(Neves et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18335/REGION.V5I1.219). However, the large amounts of aid provided were proportional to olive oil production, which incentivized significant increases and intensification of the sector [(Neves et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18335/REGION.V5I1.219). The 2003 CAP reform introduced new objectives focused on encouraging productivity, market stabilization, and protecting rural livelihoods [(Neves et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18335/REGION.V5I1.219). This reform period coincided with dramatic infrastructure improvements, as irrigated olive land expanded from 102,000 hectares in 1995 to 372,000 hectares in 2000, partly promoted by improved prices and sharp increases in production aid from EU regulations [(Lambarraa et al., 2007)](https://doi.org/10.5424/sjar/2007053-247). The economic impact was substantial, with Spanish farms specialized in olive groves increasing their economic size from about 7 European size units in 1991 to 14 units in 2000 [(Lambarraa et al., 2007)](https://doi.org/10.5424/sjar/2007053-247). The policy framework evolved further with the 2014-2020 CAP and subsequent reforms, which shifted away from subsidies directly proportional to production toward encouraging agricultural practices aimed at maximizing crop sustainability and rural development [(Sousa et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13147983). This change placed greater value on non-productive ecosystem services of olive groves, with organic farming models being promoted as environmentally friendly management approaches that enhance system sustainability [(Sousa et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13147983).

## Production Intensification and Modernization

**Summary:** CAP incentives drove dramatic intensification of Andalusian olive production through irrigation expansion, higher planting densities, mechanization, and the adoption of new cultivars, transforming traditional extensive farming into intensive and super-intensive production systems. This modernization doubled Spain's olive oil production and increased farm economic size, though it created new dependencies on water resources and subsidies. (6 sources)

The CAP reforms triggered a fundamental transformation in Andalusian olive production methods, moving away from traditional extensive farming toward intensive and super-intensive systems. This shift involved replacing old trees with new ones and dramatically increasing planting density from traditional levels of around 100 trees per hectare to 300-500 trees per hectare in intensive orchards, and even more than 1,000 trees per hectare in super-intensive operations [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12114398). By the late 20th century, revolutionary high-density hedgerow olive orchards with up to 2,000 trees per hectare were being established, compared to just 100 trees per hectare in traditional systems [(Leon, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5424/sjar/2021194-18203). A critical component of this intensification was the rapid expansion of irrigation systems. Responding to drought periods in the early 1990s and EU incentives to increase yields, Andalusia developed advanced drip irrigation and fertigation systems through joint research initiatives between the regional government and private producers in 1992 [(Neves et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18335/REGION.V5I1.219). This technological innovation was responsible for both increased productivity and the expansion of intensive olive cultivation throughout Spain, with irrigated olive land expanding from 102,000 hectares in 1995 to 372,000 hectares in 2000 [(Neves et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18335/REGION.V5I1.219) [(Lambarraa et al., 2007)](https://doi.org/10.5424/sjar/2007053-247). The modernization process also involved significant changes in cultivar selection and production methods. New growing techniques developed around 50 years ago led to a "new olive growing" era characterized by cultivars with early bearing, high productivity, and high oil content [(Leon, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5424/sjar/2021194-18203). By the 1990s, only three cultivars - 'Picual', 'Arbequina', and 'Hojiblanca' - represented more than 95% of plant production in Andalusian nurseries, replacing many traditional varieties [(Leon, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5424/sjar/2021194-18203). The economic impact of these changes was substantial, with Spanish farms specialized in olive groves doubling their economic size from about 7 European size units in 1991 to 14 units in 2000 [(Lambarraa et al., 2007)](https://doi.org/10.5424/sjar/2007053-247). EU funding helped establish intensive and super-intensive cultivation methods that served as examples for other producers while steadily increasing irrigation coverage [(Koch, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01236-6). However, this transformation created new dependencies, as conventional producers increasingly relied on CAP subsidies rather than production profitability, and intensive cultivation required large quantities of water in the water-scarce regions of southern Spain [(Sapena et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.58567/jie01040004).

## Expansion of Olive Grove Area

**Summary:** CAP subsidies made olive farming more profitable than other crops, leading Spain to expand its olive grove area by 25% between 1990 and 2020. However, by the late 1990s, available land became scarce and subsidies for new grove development were abolished, shifting focus from area expansion to productivity intensification on existing land. (4 sources)

The CAP subsidies fundamentally altered the economic incentives for Andalusian agriculture by making olive farming significantly more profitable than other types of agriculture, particularly extensive herbaceous crops. This profitability differential encouraged farmers to substantially increase their olive grove area and production [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12114398). The result was dramatic: Spain increased its olive grove area by 25% between 1990 and 2020, while simultaneously doubling its olive oil production [(Gomez-Limon et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12114398). This expansion was not limited to specific regions but affected the entirety of Andalusia, with research documenting an exponential increase in olive groves across the region. The CAP actively promoted Andalusia's specialization in olive oil production and export on a worldwide scale [(Pena-Rodriguez et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land12040747). The expansion was supported by EU funds that enabled the development of new areas while establishing intensive and super-intensive cultivation methods that served as examples for other producers [(Koch, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01236-6). However, this rapid expansion faced natural limits. By the late 1990s, available land for new olive groves became increasingly scarce, prompting policy changes. In 1998, subsidies for developing new groves were abolished as part of the EU's Common Market Organization reform for oils and fats, which excluded new plantings from areas entitled to receive production aid [(Lambarraa et al., 2007)](https://doi.org/10.5424/sjar/2007053-247) [(Koch, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01236-6). This marked the beginning of a "post-productivist" decade where no more aid was provided for groves developed after 1998, though price guarantees remained in place [(Koch, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01236-6). Following this policy shift, fewer new areas were opened for olive cultivation, but the sector's focus turned toward intensifying cultivation on existing land rather than expanding total area [(Koch, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01236-6). This transition marked a fundamental change in the sector's growth strategy from horizontal expansion to vertical intensification.

## Organizational Changes in the Sector

**Summary:** CAP subsidies made olive farms economically dependent on government support rather than market prices, leading to widespread organization into cooperatives that now process 70% of Andalusian olive oil. These cooperatives have consolidated into larger second-tier entities to compete globally, with major players like DCOOP and JAENCOOP controlling over 40% of cooperative mill turnover. (2 sources)

The CAP reforms fundamentally altered the organizational structure of Andalusian olive production by creating economic dependencies that drove farmers toward collective organization. A large proportion of Andalusian olive growers became highly dependent on subsidies to ensure their economic viability, as production costs exceeded market prices in recent years [(Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122310019). This economic reality made individual farming operations increasingly difficult to sustain independently. In response to these economic pressures and the challenges of globalization, olive growers organized extensively into cooperatives. From the middle of the last century to the first years of the 21st century, advances in the cooperative process were carried out to meet globalization challenges, resulting in a more concentrated supply of olive oil and an increased role for cooperatives in the global value chain [(Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122310019). This organizational transformation was particularly pronounced in traditional olive-growing regions, with cooperatives becoming the main players in provinces where the most traditional olive groves predominate, such as in Jaén [(Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122310019). The cooperative movement evolved beyond simple first-level organizations to create large-scale second-tier entities capable of competing in global markets. Notable examples include DCOOP, JAENCOOP, and OLEOESTEPA, whose combined turnover represents more than 40% of the total cooperative mills [(Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122310019). The scale of this cooperative organization is substantial, with cooperatives now processing 70% of Andalusian olive oil [(Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122310019). This organizational consolidation occurred alongside the structural changes that increased the economic size of individual holdings from about 7 European size units in 1991 to 14 units in 2000 [(Lambarraa et al., 2007)](https://doi.org/10.5424/sjar/2007053-247). The combination of larger individual farms and powerful cooperative organizations created a dual structure that enabled the sector to maintain viability despite its dependence on subsidies and the challenges of global competition.

## Shift Towards Organic Production

**Summary:** The 2014-2020 CAP reforms shifted away from production-based subsidies toward sustainability incentives, promoting organic olive farming as an environmentally friendly approach. CAP subsidies from the second pillar have been key in driving organic adoption, particularly in less productive mountainous areas where small agri-environmental payments can compensate for lower yields. (3 sources)

The recent evolution of CAP policy has created strong incentives for Andalusian olive producers to transition toward organic production methods. The observed expansion of organic olive groves is mainly due to changes in the common agricultural policy (CAP), together with farmers' and society's demands [(Sousa et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13147983). The current CAP (2014-2020) and its future prospects no longer shape a policy based on subsidies directly proportional to production, instead encouraging the adoption of agricultural practices aimed at maximizing crop sustainability and rural development on a regional scale, placing value on the contribution of non-productive ecosystem services of the olive grove, with the organic model being an environmentally friendly management aimed at promoting the sustainability of these systems [(Sousa et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13147983) [(Buitenhuis et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1746-692x.12286). The financial structure of CAP support has been particularly effective in promoting organic conversion in specific types of olive operations. CAP support (subsidies from the second pillar) has been a key factor in promoting the adoption of organic farming, especially in those olive groves with low levels of productivity under a conventional production system, such as olive groves in mountainous areas [(Martin-Garcia et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40100-023-00292-5). With a relatively small amount of agri-environmental subsidies, it has been possible to compensate for the drop in productivity resulting from the conversion to organic farming [(Martin-Garcia et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40100-023-00292-5). This explains why organic olive farming has already been adopted in most areas in Spain where the olive groves are relatively less productive, with average annual yields lower than 2000 kg of olives per hectare [(Martin-Garcia et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40100-023-00292-5). This shift represents a fundamental change in the sector's development trajectory, moving from the production-maximizing incentives of earlier CAP reforms toward a more sustainable and environmentally conscious approach that values ecosystem services beyond simple olive oil output.

## Regional Economic and Social Impacts

**Summary:** CAP-driven intensification of olive production has created a dual economic impact in Andalusia: while it preserved the sector for over three decades through subsidies, it has also led to rural depopulation, job losses in mountainous areas, and increased emigration due to policy uncertainty. The shift toward intensive production has made traditional rainfed olive farming less viable, threatening the social fabric of rural communities. (2 sources)

The transformation of Andalusian olive production through CAP incentives has generated significant regional economic and social consequences that extend far beyond agricultural productivity. While the policy framework has preserved the sector for over three decades, uncertainty about the EU's future policies may be contributing to the current emigration trend [(Koch, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01236-6). This creates a paradox where the very policies designed to support rural communities may be undermining their long-term sustainability. The shift toward intensive production methods has created pronounced social stratification within the sector, with different stakeholder groups holding conflicting views about CAP effectiveness. Large landowners are skeptical of subsidies that keep inefficient production methods alive, while smallholder farmers often mention that the CAP would disproportionally favor large landowners [(Koch, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01236-6). This tension reflects deeper structural changes in how agricultural profitability is achieved, as many conventional producers turn the profitability of production into a secondary value, relying on CAP subsidies to make the business profitable in the end [(Sapena et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.58567/jie01040004). The regional impacts have been particularly severe in traditional olive-growing areas. Certain forms of production such as rainfed production in mountain areas are becoming less and less viable, sometimes leading to the abandonment of olive groves, with serious consequences such as the loss of jobs in the countryside, the depopulation of large areas and the deterioration of soils [(Sapena et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.58567/jie01040004). The change toward intensive production models has created broader social and ecological consequences, including depopulation of certain areas due to lack of resources, while intensive and super-intensive cultivation requires large quantities of water, a scarce resource in the productive areas of southern Spain [(Sapena et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.58567/jie01040004). These changes represent a fundamental restructuring of Andalusia's rural economy and social organization, where traditional extensive farming communities have either adapted to intensive methods or faced economic marginalization and potential abandonment.
