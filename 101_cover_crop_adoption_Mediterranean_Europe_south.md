## Introduction and Background

**Summary:** Cover crops are increasingly promoted in Mediterranean Europe's wine and citrus regions to combat soil degradation and erosion, but adoption rates remain very low due to grower concerns about water competition, disease risks, and management complexity. (4 sources)

Cover crops represent a traditional but underutilized agricultural practice in Mediterranean Europe, where they are being increasingly incentivized across wine growing regions to address the pressing issue of soil degradation [(Lazcano et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2020.00068) [(Rodrigo-Comino et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/BEVERAGES4020031). In vineyard systems, cover crops are primarily used in interrows to prevent soil degradation and erosion, with Mediterranean countries of Europe actively promoting this practice due to severe land degradation concerns [(Lazcano et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2020.00068) [(Rodrigo-Comino et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/BEVERAGES4020031). Research has documented extremely high erosion rates in Mediterranean vineyards, with some Spanish vineyards experiencing soil losses of 4.1 Mg ha⁻¹ h⁻¹ during rainfall events [(Rodrigo-Comino et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/BEVERAGES4020031). Beyond viticulture, cover crops offer significant advantages in citrus orchards throughout Mediterranean environments, representing a key management option for these perennial cropping systems [(Mauro et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2015.641). However, despite mounting evidence of soil health benefits, adoption rates across Mediterranean Europe remain very low due to contrasting producer perceptions about actual benefits, concerns over water and nutrient competition in arid regions, lack of adequate management strategies, and fears that cover crops may increase vine susceptibility to plant diseases [(Lazcano et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2020.00068) [(Schutte et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09571264.2019.1568975). These barriers drive many growers to actively remove vegetation through tillage and herbicide applications, perpetuating negative consequences for soil health [(Lazcano et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2020.00068).

## Adoption Rates in Mediterranean Europe

**Summary:** Cover crop adoption rates across Mediterranean Europe are extremely variable, ranging from near 0% in some southern regions to over 80% in parts of France, with Spain showing particularly low adoption at only 11.6% despite having significant potential for carbon sequestration benefits. (3 sources)

Quantitative data reveal striking disparities in cover crop adoption rates across Mediterranean Europe, with overall European statistics showing cover crops occupy only 8% of arable land during winter periods [(Tittonell et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2020.584605). A comprehensive 2019 survey of over 600 farmers across Spain, France, Netherlands and Romania found average adoption rates of 11.6% across arable farms, with Spain showing the lowest adoption at 11.6% in Castillia y León region compared to 83.6% in central France [(Fohrafellner et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13472) [(Heller et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13483). The economic potential of increased adoption is substantial, particularly in Mediterranean countries where climate conditions could support expansion. Spain alone could achieve carbon sequestration of 2,592,700 tons of CO₂ equivalent across 2,399,490 hectares if adoption rates increased, representing the highest potential among surveyed countries [(Fohrafellner et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13472). Notably, Spanish adopters typically require irrigation access for their cover crops, highlighting water availability as a key constraint in Mediterranean systems [(Heller et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13483). Regional variation across Europe shows dramatic differences, with cover crop adoption ranging from 0% in northern, southern and eastern European regions to 92% along the Atlantic coast, demonstrating that Mediterranean regions consistently show among the lowest adoption rates continentwide [(Heller et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13483).

## Regional Differences Across Mediterranean Countries

**Summary:** Mediterranean countries show dramatically different cover crop adoption patterns, with France achieving over 80% adoption rates while Spain lags at only 11.6%, largely due to water limitations that force southern European farmers to choose between cover crops and other sustainable practices like no-till systems. (3 sources)

The stark contrasts in cover crop adoption across Mediterranean Europe reflect fundamental climatic and management trade-offs that vary significantly by country and region. France demonstrates the highest adoption rates among Mediterranean countries, with the Centre region achieving 83.6% farmer adoption compared to Spain's Castillia y León region at only 11.6% [(Fohrafellner et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13472) [(Heller et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13483). This disparity becomes even more pronounced when compared to northern European regions, where adoption can reach 98.7% in areas like Overijssel, Netherlands [(Heller et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13483). The underlying driver of these regional differences appears to be water availability and climate constraints that force Mediterranean farmers to make strategic choices between competing sustainable practices. Southern European farmers face a notable trade-off where water-limited conditions make cover crop establishment difficult, yet these same dry conditions promote the adoption of alternative sustainable practices like no-till systems to manage water conservation [(Vincent-Caboud et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE7050042). This explains why southern farmers show higher rates of no-till adoption but decreased cover crop use compared to northern European farmers [(Vincent-Caboud et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE7050042). Water access emerges as a critical differentiating factor, with Spanish cover crop adopters typically requiring irrigation access for successful establishment, highlighting how water availability shapes regional adoption patterns across the Mediterranean basin [(Heller et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13483). These regional constraints suggest that successful cover crop promotion strategies must account for local water resources and competing sustainable practice priorities rather than applying uniform approaches across Mediterranean Europe.

## Barriers to Cover Crop Adoption

**Summary:** Multiple interconnected barriers prevent widespread cover crop adoption in Mediterranean Europe, including economic constraints from upfront costs and revenue competition with cash crops, management complexity requiring specialized knowledge, and climate-specific challenges like water competition and disease risks that make implementation particularly difficult in dry Mediterranean conditions. (11 sources)

Economic barriers represent a fundamental constraint to cover crop adoption across Mediterranean Europe, with farmers facing both direct implementation costs and opportunity costs from replacing revenue-generating crops. The financial burden is particularly acute in rainfed Mediterranean systems where farmers must choose between autumn-planted cash crops and cover crops due to synchronized planting cycles, forcing them to balance anticipated revenue against uncertain long-term productivity gains [(Farina et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjss-2023-0106). Cost increases have been identified as a primary adoption barrier across multiple European countries including Germany and Italy [(Adamsone-Fiskovica et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1742170524000085) [(Roesch-McNally et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1742170517000096). This economic challenge is compounded by the fact that farms more dependent on crop revenue show lower cover crop adoption rates, as documented in organic vegetable operations [(Adamsone-Fiskovica et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1742170524000085). Knowledge gaps and management complexity create additional significant barriers, particularly in Mediterranean systems where specialized understanding is required to navigate water limitations and disease risks. The lack of adequate management strategies has been identified as a key constraint preventing adoption despite mounting evidence of soil health benefits [(Lazcano et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2020.00068). Technical knowledge requirements represent a substantial barrier that must be overcome for successful implementation [(Netti et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-76346-5). Furthermore, the limited availability of adapted cover crop cultivars with enhanced traits for Mediterranean climates presents a genetic barrier that constrains farmer options [(Moore et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY10091434) [(Singer et al., 2007)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00224561.2007.12435983). Climate-specific barriers in Mediterranean environments create unique adoption challenges not found in other European regions. Water competition concerns are particularly pronounced in arid Mediterranean conditions, where cover crops can lead to soil water depletion and potential yield reductions [(Netti et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-76346-5). Disease risk represents another Mediterranean-specific barrier, as cover crops can increase vine susceptibility to plant diseases or act as disease vectors [(Lazcano et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2020.00068). These climate-related challenges help explain why conservation agriculture adoption remains low across the Mediterranean region despite evidence of benefits for climate resilience [(Topp et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335083) [(Lagacherie et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-017-1239-9) [(Mrabet et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.19103/as.2021.0088.06). Institutional and policy barriers further compound adoption challenges, with some Mediterranean regions showing disconnect between policy incentives and practical implementation. In Portugal's Low Mondego Region, farmers plant cover crops solely to qualify for Common Agricultural Policy subsidies without considering agronomic benefits, leading to poor management practices that reduce profitability and increase environmental risks [(Boulet et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1515/opag-2021-0041). This highlights how poorly designed incentive structures can create barriers rather than facilitate meaningful adoption of cover crop practices.

## Driving Factors and Incentives for Adoption

**Summary:** Economic incentives, particularly EU Common Agricultural Policy subsidies, serve as primary drivers for cover crop adoption in Mediterranean Europe, though success requires combining financial support with technical knowledge transfer and education to overcome management barriers. Stakeholder recognition of ecosystem benefits like erosion control and soil fertility enhancement also motivates adoption, especially in regions vulnerable to Mediterranean flash flooding. (7 sources)

Policy incentives, particularly through the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), represent the most direct driver of cover crop adoption across Mediterranean Europe, though implementation quality varies significantly by region. In Portugal's Low Mondego Region, farmers plant winter cover crops primarily to qualify for CAP subsidies, with yellow lupin being the most common species choice [(Boulet et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1515/opag-2021-0041). However, this subsidy-driven approach can be counterproductive when farmers ignore agronomic benefits and fail to integrate cover crops properly into their management systems, leading to over-fertilization and systematic pesticide use that reduces profitability [(Boulet et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1515/opag-2021-0041). Economic interests play a decisive role in Mediterranean farmers' adoption decisions, with research showing that level of education and land ownership (as opposed to leasing) correlate positively with conservation agriculture adoption in regions prone to soil erosion [(Topp et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335083). This pattern has been documented specifically among Spanish olive growers, where economic considerations drive soil management practice choices [(Topp et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335083). Stakeholder recognition of ecosystem benefits serves as another important adoption driver, with 60% of stakeholders rating cover crops as extremely useful for Mediterranean agricultural systems [(Netti et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-76346-5). This recognition stems from cover crops' demonstrated ability to control erosion and enhance soil fertility [(Netti et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-76346-5) [(Basche et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215702), improve soil moisture retention [(Netti et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-76346-5) [(Basche et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215702), reduce herbicide use through weed suppression, and enhance soil microbial communities by increasing mycorrhizal abundance and phosphatase activity [(Netti et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-76346-5) [(Hallama et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11104-018-3810-7). The timing is particularly relevant for Mediterranean wheat systems, where soil remains bare during summer months when flash floods are most common [(Netti et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-76346-5). Carbon sequestration potential provides an additional economic incentive for adoption, with Mediterranean perennial systems showing particularly high rates. Cover cropping in olive orchards, vineyards, and almond orchards can achieve carbon sequestration rates up to 5.3 tons C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, representing substantially higher rates than fields with low or no cover cropping [(Farooqi et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.5772/INTECHOPEN.79336) [(Olson et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.4236/OJSS.2014.48030). This suggests that carbon credit programs could provide meaningful financial incentives for Mediterranean farmers to adopt cover cropping practices.

## Success Stories and Benefits in Mediterranean Systems

**Summary:** Mediterranean cover crop implementations have demonstrated remarkable success stories, with Italian olive orchards showing yield increases from 6 to over 13 kg per plant and carbon sequestration rates reaching 5.3 tons per hectare annually in perennial systems. Meta-analyses confirm these benefits occur without yield penalties across Mediterranean agricultural systems. (5 sources)

Documented field trials across Mediterranean Europe provide compelling evidence of cover crop success, particularly in perennial cropping systems where long-term benefits become most apparent. In Italian olive orchards, multi-year experiments have demonstrated substantial productivity gains, with permanent cover cropped plots achieving average yields of 10.2 kg per plant compared to 6 kg per plant in conventionally managed systems after two years [(Santilli et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2011.6.S1.E15). These benefits proved even more pronounced over longer timeframes, with five-year results showing cover cropped plots averaging 13.59 kg per plant versus 10.73 kg in tilled plots. The most dramatic success story comes from a seven-year trial in Italy's semi-arid olive growing regions, where sustainable management with spontaneous cover crops produced consistently every year with average yields of 8.4 Mg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹, while traditionally managed plots with periodic tillage showed lower production at 3.1 Mg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ and strong yield alternation with little to no production in alternate years [(Santilli et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2011.6.S1.E15). This demonstrates how cover crops can eliminate the problematic yield alternation that plagues Mediterranean olive production. Carbon sequestration represents another major success metric for Mediterranean cover crop systems, with perennial orchards achieving the highest documented rates globally. Mediterranean olive orchards, vineyards, and almond orchards with cover crops have demonstrated carbon sequestration rates up to 5.3 tons C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, substantially higher than fields with low or no cover cropping [(Farooqi et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.5772/INTECHOPEN.79336) [(Olson et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.4236/OJSS.2014.48030). This represents both an environmental success and a potential economic opportunity through carbon credit markets. Meta-analytical evidence confirms that these success stories represent broader patterns rather than isolated cases, with comprehensive analyses of Mediterranean agricultural systems demonstrating multiple benefits to soil health, biodiversity, and pest control without yield penalties [(Silva et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1002/pan3.10613) [(Winter et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13124). The consistency of positive outcomes across different Mediterranean countries and cropping systems suggests that successful implementation is achievable when appropriate management strategies are employed.
