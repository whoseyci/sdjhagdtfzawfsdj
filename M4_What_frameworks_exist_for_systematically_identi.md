**Research Query:** M.4 What frameworks exist for systematically identifying and categorizing barriers to agricultural conservation practice adoption?

---

## Introduction

**Summary:** Several systematic frameworks have been developed to identify and categorize barriers that prevent farmers from adopting conservation practices. These frameworks help researchers and policymakers better understand why conservation adoption rates remain low despite available incentives and programs. (LLM Memory)

Understanding barriers to agricultural conservation practice adoption has become increasingly important as policymakers and researchers seek to improve environmental outcomes while maintaining agricultural productivity. Multiple systematic frameworks have emerged to help identify, categorize, and analyze the complex array of factors that prevent or discourage farmers from implementing conservation practices such as cover crops, nutrient management, and soil health improvements . These frameworks provide structured approaches for researchers to move beyond anecdotal evidence and develop comprehensive taxonomies of adoption barriers . The development of such frameworks is crucial because barriers to conservation adoption are multifaceted, often interconnected, and can vary significantly across different farming systems, geographic regions, and individual farm operations . By using systematic frameworks, researchers can ensure more consistent data collection, enable better comparison across studies, and ultimately inform more effective policy interventions and outreach programs designed to increase conservation practice adoption rates .

## Existing Frameworks for Barrier Identification and Categorization

**Summary:** Researchers have developed several systematic frameworks to categorize barriers to conservation adoption, ranging from simple four-category models based on farmer and farm characteristics to complex multi-domain frameworks that examine institutional, policy, and farmer experience factors. (6 sources)

Several distinct frameworks have emerged to systematically identify and categorize barriers to agricultural conservation practice adoption: • **Knowler and Bradshaw Four-Category Framework** - This framework divides 46 adoption factors into four groups: farmer and farm household characteristics (age, gender), farm biophysical characteristics (farm size, slope), farm financial/management characteristics (tenure, labor requirements), and exogenous factors (price fluctuations, access to extension services) [(Kongsager, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/F8070260). • **Multi-Domain Dis-adoption Drivers Framework** - This empirically grounded framework examines barriers across multiple domains (public policies, institutional arrangements of promoters, and farmers' experiences) and at multiple levels (global, national, and local), emphasizing the complex interactions between different types of barriers [(Chinseu et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.5539/jsd.v12n5p48). • **Qualitative Expert Assessment Tool for CA Adoption (QAToCA)** - This multi-theoretical framework evaluates barriers across seven thematic areas: characteristics of conservation agriculture as an adoption object, capacity of promoting organizations, attributes of diffusion strategy, institutional frame conditions at regional and village levels, market conditions, and community perceptions [(Anibaldi et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND10040386). • **Livelihood Platform Analysis (LPA)** - Based on sustainable livelihood frameworks, this approach explores technology uptake barriers at individual, household, community, and institutional platform levels, examining how four resource pillars (physical, financial, human, and informational) support various livelihood strategies [(Anibaldi et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND10040386). • **Integrated Reasoned Action Approach/Theory of Planned Behavior Framework** - This framework incorporates farmer/farm characteristics, perceived practice characteristics (derived from Diffusion of Innovations Theory), informational factors, and contextual factors to predict farmer behavior [(Ansari et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.12944/CARJ.6.2.04). • **Multi-Scale BMP Adoption Framework** - This conceptual framework recognizes both micro and macro scales of influence on adoption decisions, emphasizing factors operating at larger scales [(Liu et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su10020432). • **Three-Category Participatory Framework** - Used in systematic literature reviews, this approach categorizes stakeholder-perceived obstacles into technical-agronomic, socio-economic, and policy-legislative aspects [(Tranchina et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-024-00993-w).

## Common Barrier Categories Identified

**Summary:** Across different frameworks, researchers consistently identify several major categories of barriers including economic/financial constraints, knowledge and information gaps, structural and institutional factors, resource access limitations, and social/cultural barriers that operate at both field-level and broader system scales. (7 sources)

Despite the variety of frameworks used to categorize barriers, research consistently identifies several major categories of constraints that prevent farmers from adopting conservation practices. **Economic and financial barriers** emerge as primary constraints, including direct costs for equipment, seeds, fencing, and other inputs required for conservation practices, as well as financial limitations that prevent farmers from making necessary investments [(Silva et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1090690). These economic factors interact with farmers' perceptions of financial risk and uncertainty about production outcomes [(Silva et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1090690). **Knowledge and information gaps** represent another major barrier category, with lack of specific technical knowledge about best management practices being identified as a significant constraint by researchers [(Silva et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1090690). This includes both awareness of conservation programs and practices as well as understanding how to successfully implement them [(Prokopy et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.2489/jswc.74.5.520). **Resource access limitations** frequently constrain adoption, including lack of access to specialized equipment, markets for diversified crops, herbicides and other inputs, and competition for crop residues needed for livestock feeding [(Silva et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1090690) [(Steenwerth et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1186/2048-7010-3-11). **Labor and time constraints** create additional barriers, with increased labor demands for practices like weeding often changing traditional agricultural work patterns and gender divisions [(Steenwerth et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1186/2048-7010-3-11) [(Silva et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1090690). **Social and institutional barriers** include factors such as farmland lease terms, rental dynamics, cognitive and interpersonal factors, and social exclusion processes that can constrain access to information and implementation opportunities [(Cureton et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1014934) [(Carter, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2019.1584657). Research distinguishes between **field-level barriers** (such as proper planting techniques) and **structural barriers** (such as market forces and policy constraints) that operate at broader system scales [(Roesch-McNally et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1742170517000096). This multi-scale perspective recognizes that environmental, social, economic, and political factors interact across different levels to constrain farmers' land management decisions [(Surdoval et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad35d8). Understanding these barrier categories helps inform more targeted interventions and policy approaches to increase conservation practice adoption rates.

## Methodological Approaches

**Summary:** Researchers use diverse methodological approaches to study barriers to conservation adoption, including quantitative models like multivariate probit analysis, qualitative techniques such as social cognitive mapping, and theory-driven frameworks that examine both individual and contextual factors. (3 sources)

The methodological approaches used to identify and categorize barriers to agricultural conservation practice adoption vary considerably across studies, reflecting the complexity of farmer decision-making processes. **Quantitative approaches** include sophisticated statistical models such as multivariate probit models applied to large-scale survey data from thousands of households and focus groups to systematically identify drivers and barriers of conservation adoption across multiple countries [(Tufa et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1151876). These quantitative methods allow researchers to analyze relationships between multiple variables simultaneously and test hypotheses across large sample sizes. **Qualitative methodological approaches** provide deeper insights into the complexity of barrier relationships and farmer perceptions. Social cognitive mapping approaches analyze interview transcripts to identify recurring concepts and relationships between these concepts, with centrality indicators calculated to measure the number of relationships each concept has with other identified barriers [(Heller et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13483). This method helps researchers understand not just individual barriers but how different constraints interconnect and influence each other. **Theory-driven methodological frameworks** represent a notable approach that incorporates existing behavior change theories to examine conservation behaviors [(Ranjan et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2019.1648710). These methods draw on established theories such as the Theory of Planned Behavior, Reasoned Action Approach, and Diffusion of Innovations to understand individual-level farmer behavior. However, research suggests that theoretically grounded understanding of conservation behavior using frameworks that incorporate both individual and contextual-level factors presents opportunities for future development, with governance analytical lenses offering potential starting points since farmer decision-making occurs within larger institutional, market, and governance contexts [(Ranjan et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2019.1648710). Scholars can also build off existing theories while using inductive approaches to help untangle the complexity of farmer decision-making processes.
