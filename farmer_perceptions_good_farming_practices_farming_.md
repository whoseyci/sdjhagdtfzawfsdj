## Introduction: Theoretical Foundation of Good Farmer Identity

**Summary:** The "good farmer" concept has become a key framework in rural scholarship over the past two decades, grounded in Bourdieusian theory to explain how farming identities, practices, and resistance to change emerge through cultural capital and social norms. This concept serves as both an analytical tool and methodological approach for understanding how farmers' sense of competence, community belonging, and symbolic practices shape their agricultural behaviors. (4 sources)

The concept of the "good farmer" has received considerable attention within rural scholarship over the course of the last two decades, with theoretical foundations rooted in the work of Bourdieu [(Franklin et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.JRURSTUD.2021.02.012). Bourdieu's conceptualization of habitus, capital, and field supports analysis of how farming practice, attitudes and disposition emerge, are sustained and occasionally change at both individual and collective levels [(Franklin et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.JRURSTUD.2021.02.012). This framework examines the recognition, valuing and deployment of varying forms of capital - including economic, social and cultural capital - by farmers and other stakeholders operating within the same field of action [(Franklin et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.JRURSTUD.2021.02.012). The good farmer literature has gained sufficient acceptance in academia that it has become a common reference for social norms in agriculture [(Sutherland, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/SORU.12344). The concept serves as both an analytical lens and methodological tool, as it has been developed for eliciting responses relating to social norms in a way that is comfortable for farmers [(Sutherland, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/SORU.12344) [(Chan et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2023.03.013). When farmers use the term, it primarily functions as a common-sense category to refer to farmers whose practices demonstrate competence, with "good" being a positive assessment of skills [(Sutherland, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/SORU.12344). The theoretical foundation reveals that good farming concepts stem from a primary need to have a clear sense of collective identity and group belonging [(Enticott, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13620-023-00245-w). Group identities exist around core shared principles - known as the "rules of the game" - that are learned through socialization and form familiar stories which script behaviors and express cultural groups' wider values [(Enticott, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13620-023-00245-w). These rules are articulated symbolically, allowing farmers to visually demonstrate their group allegiance while enabling others to recognize group membership [(Enticott, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13620-023-00245-w). The more cultural capital accumulated through these symbols, the more status one has as a good farmer and the more trust is gained from others in the farming community [(Enticott, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13620-023-00245-w). This theoretical framework has been particularly useful for explaining resistance to change, as farmers may resist incorporating new practices perceived as constituting a shift away from established farm identity, based on anticipated loss of identity or social and cultural rewards [(Franklin et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.JRURSTUD.2021.02.012).

## Core Components and Symbols of Good Farmer Identity

**Summary:** Good farmer identity is built on four key components: visual appearance of crops/livestock, production yields, local peer comparison through "hedgerow farming," and farm physical characteristics including family history. These identities are dominated by productivist values emphasizing high yields and efficiency, with tillage practices and "tidy" field appearance serving as crucial status symbols that farmers use to demonstrate competence and maintain community standing. (5 sources)

The good farmer identity framework reveals four fundamental sub-identity standards that define farming competence and status. These include: (1) physical appearance of the crop and/or livestock; (2) crop yield per hectare or other similar measures of production; (3) "hedgerow farming" which is the comparison and evaluation process of how well farmers in specific geographic areas are meeting the local, informal, farming standards; and (4) the "farm" identity which represents the farm's physical characteristics as well as the family farming the land and the history of the farm [(McGuire et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1007/S10460-012-9381-Y) [(McGuire et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-012-9381-y). Research shows that farming is "heavily imbued with status symbols" which contribute to the notion of "good farming" and play an important role in guiding and shaping farmer behavior [(Hidano et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2019.00320). These status symbols are frequently linked to the ability to maintain "tidy landscapes," produce quality livestock or operate a successful business objectified through new machinery [(Hidano et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2019.00320). The open nature of farming allows farmers to constantly examine other farms for the symbols of good farming through a process known as "hedgerow farming" - evaluating elements such as maintaining tidy farm yards, planting crops in straight lines, and maintaining effective stock fences [(Hidano et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2019.00320). The dominance of productivist identity emerges clearly in farmer categorizations, with 78% of farmers describing themselves as those who rely on improved yields, land acquisition, and improved operational efficiencies as the way to increase income, thereby demonstrating their good farmer identity [(McGuire et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1007/S10460-012-9381-Y) [(McGuire et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-012-9381-y). In contrast, only 8% of farmers identify as conservationists who take an environmental manager approach when planning and implementing farm management practices [(McGuire et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1007/S10460-012-9381-Y) [(McGuire et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-012-9381-y). Tillage practices serve as particularly powerful symbols of good farming competence. The prominence of tillage as a concept for conventional farmers demonstrates the importance of the plough and of tilling as a skilled activity, suggesting that for conventional farmers, a 'good farmer' is one that implements a set of accepted best management practices [(Topp et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335083). Tillage is key to having 'clean fields', which are seen as visible outcomes of farming efficiency and skill [(Topp et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335083). These symbols align with productivist values, such as maintaining a tidy farm appearance through straight-lined and weed-free crops, and are related to economic efficiency as evenly ploughed fields ensure regular sowing depths and parallel lines ensure that pesticides and herbicides are evenly dispensed [(Topp et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335083). The visual assessment aspect of good farmer identity extends to public perception, with research showing that frontage of a farming operation on a busy road was positively associated with additional uptake of 'good management practices' that are easily recognizable by the public [(Booth et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/03036758.2024.2351910). This demonstrates how farmers' judgement of other farmers' skill and success based on how their farmland looks from the roadside - termed "roadside farming" - reinforces symbolic capital and status within farming communities [(Topp et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335083).

## Cultural Resistance to Conservation Practices

**Summary:** Farmers resist conservation practices like no-tillage because these methods conflict with deeply held cultural values and symbols of "good farming," particularly the belief that plowing demonstrates skill and produces "clean" fields. This resistance stems from farmers' need to maintain their professional identity and social status within farming communities, even when conservation practices might offer economic or environmental benefits. (7 sources)

Cultural resistance to conservation agriculture emerges from fundamental conflicts between new practices and established farming identities. The behaviors associated with the good farmer are not necessarily those that deliver the highest economic returns, but can be about meeting other existential, stylistic or moral goals, and if a practice or landscape conflicts with these objectives, there will be resistance towards adoption [(Cusworth et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-021-10215-z). This resistance is particularly strong for conservation practices because they challenge core symbols of farming competence that have been central to farmer identity formation. The conversion from tillage to no-tillage agriculture represents a radical transformation that necessitates alterations not only in farm equipment and work organization, but also in concepts of agriculture and personal and professional identities [(Cicek et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-023-00926-4) [(Topp et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-023-10495-7). Among the factors driving the refusal of no-tillage or reduced tillage practices are rooted beliefs, attitudes and social perceptions of farmers, meaning that switching to soil conservation measures requires farmers to alter not only their daily farming routines, but also their perception of the aesthetics of cultivated land and images of themselves [(Cicek et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-023-00926-4) [(Rust et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.35241/emeraldopenres.13412.1). Conservation agriculture practices may be rejected by farmers because they do not produce commonly acknowledged symbols of 'good farming' that have contributed to the formation of farmers' identities [(Topp et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335083) [(McGuire et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1007/S10460-012-9381-Y). For Mediterranean communities in particular, the plough symbolizes tradition and has sustained yields for centuries, making intensive tillage a central feature of agricultural management where traditional and smallholder farming remains the norm [(Topp et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335083) [(Mrabet et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.19103/as.2021.0088.06). Farmers may feel that reducing tillage under conservation agriculture may lead to them being judged as untidy, incompetent, or inefficient [(Topp et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335083). The resistance is reinforced by persistent beliefs about tillage benefits despite scientific evidence to the contrary. Farmers often do not perceive tillage as something that can degrade soils, instead viewing it as essential for controlling weeds, eliminating competition for nutrients and water, and maintaining "clean land" [(Cicek et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-023-00926-4). Beliefs about the benefits of tillage for water availability and yield persist among Mediterranean farmers, demonstrating how cultural perceptions can override scientific knowledge [(Cicek et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-023-00926-4) [(Topp et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-023-10495-7). However, research suggests that through changing conditions in agricultural economics and widening awareness around environmental issues associated with intensive agriculture, this cultural resistance has begun to abate in some contexts [(Cusworth et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-021-10215-z).

## Traditional Practices and Cultural Heritage in Farming Identity

**Summary:** Traditional farming practices are increasingly viewed as both innovative and sustainable alternatives to industrial agriculture, with farmers finding ways to align heritage methods with modern environmental values. This creates new pathways for "good farmer" identity that honor cultural continuity while meeting contemporary sustainability goals. (4 sources)

The relationship between traditional practices and farming identity reveals a complex reframing where heritage methods are increasingly perceived as innovative rather than outdated. Wine producers regard traditional methods and farming approaches as innovative, "new", and more ecologically friendly, especially in comparison with conventional, industrialized farming, with both successor farmers and newcomers regarding traditional farming as a more sustainable way of farming [(Csizmady et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land10080815). This perspective challenges the assumption that tradition and innovation are opposing forces in agricultural development. Organic farming serves as a bridge between traditional practices and contemporary environmental values, with farmers perceiving it as both honoring heritage and providing for future generations. Some farmers view organic farming as a traditional form of agriculture and a way to provide appropriate farming conditions for future generations, with many perceiving their farming practices to be innately organic and relating closed circular systems to organic farming [(Leitner et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12219160). This connection allows farmers to maintain cultural continuity while adapting to modern sustainability demands. Cultural landscape preservation emerges as a key component of traditional farming identity, where farmers see themselves as stewards of both land and heritage. Farmers perceive themselves as preservers of the cultural landscape since they keep the landscape open and tidy, demonstrating their skills in managing their fields to their peers, with considerations related to history and tradition playing a key role when many farmers aim to keep the landscape open in order to continue in the tradition of their ancestors [(Moroder et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1080/26395916.2022.2107080). This dual role as producer and cultural preservationist creates new dimensions of "good farming" that extend beyond purely economic or yield-based measures. The integration of traditional practices with modern farming identity reflects deeper cultural ties that connect farmers to their land beyond purely agricultural purposes. Farmers' cognitive associations with soil show awareness of soil as a living resource, go beyond agriculture and livelihoods to reveal cultural ties, and link to multiple levels of human needs [(Topp et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-023-10495-7). This cultural connection to land and traditional methods provides farmers with alternative pathways to demonstrate competence and maintain status within their communities while adapting to changing agricultural contexts.

## Factors Influencing Farmer Identity Change and Practice Adoption

**Summary:** Farmer identity change occurs through exposure to new values and evolving social norms, with environmental stewardship increasingly integrated into "good farmer" definitions alongside traditional production goals. Success depends on compatibility with existing cultural contexts, community support, and addressing structural constraints rather than just providing information. (12 sources)

The evolution of farmer identity reveals that exposure to novel value systems can augment rather than replace existing "good farmer" norms. New organic farmers encounter alternative values such as animal welfare, soil health, and quality food production that expand beyond the typical production-orientation of conventional farming identities [(Hayden et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10124606). Similarly, conventional farmers transitioning to low-input systems often reshape their understanding of good farming as they encounter organic farming values, demonstrating that identity transformation can occur gradually through practice adoption [(Hayden et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10124606). Research shows that traditional productivist symbols of good farming are being re-negotiated to include environmental goals, with environmental stewardship now recognized as a component of "good farmer" identity [(Coyne et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.105174) [(McGuire et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1007/S10460-012-9381-Y). This shift reflects changing "rules of the game" where environmentally aware farmers are increasingly viewed as good farmers [(Coyne et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.105174) [(Wheeler et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1177/2514848618817487). Farmers increasingly express environmental guardianship as a core component of their identity, viewing themselves as caretakers of the countryside and emphasizing the interconnection between environmental, economic, social, and cultural sustainability [(Follett et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-024-04459-y). The success of practice adoption depends heavily on compatibility with farmers' existing social and cultural contexts. Social and moral concerns, including alignment with values, traditional farming experiences, and present needs, positively influence organic farming adoption [(Rota et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13147978). Community dynamics play a crucial role, as decision-making processes are often rooted in community discussion to balance perceived needs of the land and farm business [(Follett et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-024-04459-y). Societal norms and perceptions of others shape farmers' decision-making in farming practices [(Nguyen-Thi-Kim et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e31792), while a sense of community, self-identity, and psychological factors determine adoption of farming practices [(Maharjan et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114523). Importantly, research demonstrates that structural limitations rather than lack of information often constrain practice change. Studies across various contexts reveal that when farmers do not follow recommendations, economic and labor constraints are typically the reason rather than lack of knowledge [(Craighead et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247644) [(Fischer et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-15015). This finding challenges approaches that focus primarily on education and information transfer, suggesting that addressing systemic barriers may be more effective for facilitating identity change and practice adoption. Future research directions point toward integrating psychological models to better understand sustainable farmer identities, including prototypical influences around "eco-friendly farmer" identities and how intentional, planned behaviors develop in sustainable farming contexts [(Maltby, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0301881) [(Achtziger et al., 2008)](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511499821.012).

## Diversity of Farmer Identity Types

**Summary:** Farming identity encompasses diverse types ranging from productivist to conservationist orientations, with organic and conventional farmers showing distinct approaches to biodiversity and environmental values. These identity differences significantly influence farmers' willingness to adopt new practices and their definitions of what constitutes "good farming." (3 sources)

Research reveals that farming represents more than an occupation, with some scholars suggesting it functions as an ethnicity, where producers' primary motivation is not profit but the act of farming itself as "a vocation and a lifestyle, with profitability being a means to an end, not an end in itself" [(King et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.4148/1051-0834.2369). This deep emotional attachment is strengthened by family heritage, as producers use "their family legacies and life experiences on the farm to inform their sense of who they are and what a farmer ought to be" [(King et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.4148/1051-0834.2369). The definitions used by producers to constitute good farming vary considerably across different farmer types. While the most prevalent identity in the United States remains the hyper-productive, input-intensive productivist focused on ever-increasing yields, other distinct types include conservationists who prioritize environmental stewardship, conventional farmers who take few risks and maintain consistency, and progressive innovators who focus on sustainable production and new techniques [(King et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.4148/1051-0834.2369) [(McGuire et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1007/S10460-012-9381-Y). Producers assess other farmers using criteria such as community participation, respectability, and farming ability, but apply these standards differently based on their own identity type [(King et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.4148/1051-0834.2369). Significant differences emerge between organic and conventional farmer identities, particularly in their approach to biodiversity and environmental values. Organic farmers tend to have a more complex and philosophical approach to biodiversity, showing greater consistency among themselves in their perceptions, while conventional farmers exhibit more variation in their attitudes and place greater emphasis on economic value [(Bavec et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5772/58974). Both types recognize ethical and social values as important, but their different priorities influence their willingness to adopt biodiversity-friendly farming practices [(Bavec et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5772/58974). These identity differences have profound implications for agricultural decision-making, as producers' self-concept and identity directly affect their adoption of new practices, particularly pro-environmental measures. When farmers commit to specific practices or sectors, these choices become integral to their identity, making it difficult to consider changing those commitments and creating resistance to practices that conflict with their established farmer type [(King et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.4148/1051-0834.2369).
