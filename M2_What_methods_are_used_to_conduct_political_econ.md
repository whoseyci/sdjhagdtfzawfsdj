## Introduction and Background

**Summary:** Political economy analysis of agricultural policy evolved from simple neoclassical price analysis to complex frameworks that examine how political, economic and social structures shape policy outcomes. This approach emerged in the 1950s-1980s as scholars recognized the need to move beyond technical analysis to understand the real-world dynamics of agricultural policy making. (3 sources)

Political economy analysis of agricultural policy has undergone significant evolution from its early neoclassical foundations. Traditional approaches focused primarily on understanding agricultural policies as instruments that shift price incentives for producer and consumer groups, with changes in consumer and producer surplus serving as welfare indicators [(Ncube, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.2174/1874331501711010035). However, advances in computational capabilities and theoretical developments led to recognition that neoclassical assumptions were inadequate for understanding real-world agricultural policy dynamics, giving rise to the Political Economy of Agriculture as a distinct school of thought [(Ncube, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.2174/1874331501711010035). The field gained momentum through landmark research beginning with Robert Bates' 1981 work on Africa, which documented how political leaders imposed high taxation on agriculture through distorted exchange rates while providing targeted support to selected producers [(David, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18535/ijsrm/v6i6.sh03). The analytical framework was subsequently expanded by incorporating institutional economics concepts including market and government failures and imperfect information, recognizing that agricultural policy choices occur under conditions far from perfect markets [(David, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18535/ijsrm/v6i6.sh03). Modern political economy analysis serves as a methodology to identify barriers and enablers to policy reform by situating interventions within broader political, economic and social structures and processes [(Heenan et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274246). This approach can be either retrospective to explain past policy decisions or prospective to analyze current situations and propose strategies, and can be applied at different stages of the policy cycle including agenda setting, policy design, adoption and implementation [(Heenan et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274246). The methodology moves beyond simple explanations of "lack of political will" to examine structural factors, bargaining processes, stakeholder incentives and underlying ideas that shape agricultural policy outcomes [(Heenan et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274246).

## Quantitative Methods

**Summary:** Quantitative methods in political economy analysis of agricultural policy include partial equilibrium models, econometric approaches like GMM, and simulation models that assess policy impacts on production, trade, and welfare outcomes. These methods reveal how political variables influence subsidy allocation patterns and demonstrate that agricultural policies can significantly affect market outcomes and voter behavior. (11 sources)

Political economy analysis employs several quantitative modeling approaches to examine agricultural policy impacts. Partial equilibrium (PE) models represent a foundational quantitative method, consisting of demand and supply equations that focus on specific agricultural markets while holding other economic factors constant [(Crouch et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3768/RTIPRESS.2017.OP.0034.1701). These models are particularly useful for assessing crop-specific subsidies or taxes and their effects on production levels and prices. Prominent PE models widely cited in policy analyses include the Forestry and Agriculture Sector Optimization Model (FASOM), the Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM), the International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities Trade (IMPACT), and the Policy Analysis System model [(Crouch et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3768/RTIPRESS.2017.OP.0034.1701). Econometric modeling represents another key quantitative approach, with the generalized method of moments (GMM) being particularly prominent for analyzing political economy factors in agricultural policy [(Omeje et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.46545/AIJAS.V1I1.16) [(Kvartiuk et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1057/s41294-020-00131-2) [(Kvartiuk et al._1, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1057/s41294-020-00131-2). The two-step GMM with finite-sample corrected standard errors is specifically used to explore links between agricultural subsidies and political economy variables, addressing issues of endogeneity through instrumental variables constructed from lagged dependent variables [(Kvartiuk et al._1, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1057/s41294-020-00131-2). Additional quantitative frameworks include specialized global models for policy evaluation. The GTAP (Global Trade Analysis Project) provides a global network approach for quantitative analysis of international economic policy issues, describing bilateral trade flows, production, consumption, and intermediate goods usage [(Namitulina et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1051/E3SCONF/202125410004). The Aglink model enables prediction of production, consumption, foreign trade, and prices for major agricultural commodities through over 11,000 equations covering 39 countries and 19 regions [(Namitulina et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1051/E3SCONF/202125410004). The Policy Evaluation Model (PEM) serves as a partial equilibrium model describing markets for major crops and livestock while incorporating agricultural producer support indicators [(Namitulina et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1051/E3SCONF/202125410004). Contemporary quantitative approaches have evolved to include hybrid methodologies and advanced analytical techniques. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methods are used to construct Malmquist index models for measuring agricultural efficiency and analyzing relationships between subsidies and productivity [(Li et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192113797). Difference-in-difference models combined with quasi-natural experiments provide robust frameworks for evaluating agricultural subsidy reforms and their impacts on agricultural development [(Dube et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/23322039.2023.2285068) [(Ye et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13020251). Input-output matrix analysis combined with total factor productivity decomposition enables calculation of "pure political rent" in agricultural subsidies [(Czyzewski et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.17306/J.JARD.2017.00303). Research demonstrates a notable trend toward methodological sophistication, with 32% of policy evaluation studies using statistical tools including econometric models, while simulation models and agent-based models have gained prominence since 2011 [(Bastidas-Orrego et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e20292). Studies increasingly employ difference-in-difference techniques combined with propensity score matching methods to examine policy effects while controlling for nonlinearities and unobserved heterogeneities [(Olper et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1093/WBER/LHT003).

## Qualitative Methods

**Summary:** Qualitative methods in political economy analysis include stakeholder mapping, focus group interviews, key informant interviews, and thematic analysis to understand political dynamics and implementation challenges. These methods reveal stakeholder preferences, barriers to reform, and the role of interests, ideas, and influence in shaping agricultural policy outcomes. (4 sources)

Qualitative approaches in political economy analysis of agricultural policy focus on understanding stakeholder perspectives, political dynamics, and implementation processes through direct engagement with policy actors. Focus group interviews represent a core qualitative method, used to understand stakeholder preferences, expectations, and likely reactions to policy reforms among beneficiaries of existing systems [(Fritz et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0121-1). These interviews can be stratified by socioprofessional categories using multicriteria assessments that consider household head education, residence type, and location to capture diverse perspectives across different social groups [(Fritz et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0121-1). Stakeholder mapping constitutes another fundamental qualitative technique, involving systematic identification and analysis of different groups affected by agricultural policies [(Fritz et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0121-1). This approach helps researchers understand the political landscape and power dynamics that influence policy outcomes. Key informant interviews with government and industry stakeholders provide insights into policy processes, implementation challenges, and the interests of different actors involved in agricultural policy making [(Walls et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002410) [(Fritz et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0121-1). Qualitative field interviews combined with secondary data analysis enable researchers to investigate agricultural public investments and policy decisions within broader political economy frameworks [(Mogues et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1111/SAJE.12076). These methods are particularly useful for understanding bargaining processes between stakeholders and their relative bargaining power, which can lead to policy fragmentation and implementation deficits [(Walls et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002410). Thematic analysis serves as the primary analytical approach for processing qualitative data in political economy studies. Researchers use inductive and iterative coding approaches that move from codes to categories to themes [(Walls et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002410) [(Braun et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3402/qhw.v9.26152). The development of coding frameworks is typically informed by political economy analysis frameworks, with themes established under key headings including structures and context, bargaining processes, stakeholders, incentives, and ideas [(Walls et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002410). Qualitative methods are particularly valuable for understanding how stakeholders' ideas, interests, and influence shape policy evolution and create constraints to policy improvement [(Walls et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002410). These approaches can identify possible avenues for reform and inform communication strategies to increase acceptance of policy changes, moving beyond simple explanations of "lack of political will" to unpack political dynamics in greater detail [(Fritz et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0121-1).

## Mixed and Hybrid Methods

**Summary:** Mixed and hybrid methods combine quantitative modeling with qualitative stakeholder engagement to better capture both economic impacts and political dynamics in agricultural policy analysis. These approaches have become increasingly prominent since 2011, addressing limitations of purely quantitative methods that often miss social variables like culture, values, and customs that influence policy outcomes. (2 sources)

The evolution of political economy analysis has led to increasing adoption of mixed and hybrid methodologies that integrate quantitative and qualitative approaches to address the complexity of agricultural policy evaluation. Since 2011, there has been a notable trend toward hybrid models, agent-based models, simulation, and experiments including discrete choice experiments and laboratory and field experiments, while continuing to use econometric models that focus on micro and macroeconomic variables [(Bastidas-Orrego et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e20292). The Computable General Political Economy (CGPE) model represents a sophisticated hybrid approach that combines econometric estimation with stakeholder participation modeling. This method models participation of stakeholder organizations in two ways: first as classical lobbying influence and second as informational influence within a model of political belief formation [(Henning et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-60714-6_11). The CGPE approach involves econometric estimation of policy beliefs and political knowledge of different stakeholder organizations, using GAMS implementation with different eCGPE modules that are empirically specified [(Henning et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-60714-6_11). The need for mixed methodologies arises from the recognition that agricultural policy evaluation involves social variables that are difficult to quantify, such as culture, self-concepts, producer values, and peasant customs [(Bastidas-Orrego et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e20292). These variables are often left out of purely quantitative evaluations, leading researchers to combine models and use mixed methodologies to evaluate policy impacts, particularly for complex policy frameworks like the Common Agricultural Policy [(Bastidas-Orrego et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e20292). Research using hybrid approaches reveals important insights about the gap between economic modeling and political practice. Analysis using the CGPE model found that inefficient agricultural policies mainly result from lack of adequate political knowledge rather than biased political incentives, and that policy beliefs of political practitioners differ significantly from economic models [(Henning et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-60714-6_11). These findings suggest that adequate political knowledge does not yet exist in the scientific system or political practice and must be created through the political process using tools that facilitate interactive communication and policy learning among stakeholders and economic modelers [(Henning et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-60714-6_11).

## Specific Analytical Frameworks

**Summary:** Researchers use several established analytical frameworks for political economy analysis of agricultural policy, including the Birner framework for mapping policy actors and coalitions, Nedergaard's supply-demand model for political decisions, OECD policy paradigm analysis, and water-agriculture systems analysis. These frameworks provide structured approaches to examine how different stakeholders, institutions, and paradigms shape agricultural policy outcomes. (6 sources)

• **Birner Framework for Policy Process Analysis**: This framework distinguishes different policy actors called "interest groups" that share common interests and beliefs regarding agricultural policies [(David, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18535/ijsrm/v6i6.sh03). Key policy actors include economic interest groups, members of the bureaucracy, legislators, judiciary, State House/Cabinet/Executive, political parties, civil society groups, applied researchers, media, non-governmental organizations, emerging private-sector enterprises, multinational enterprises, international organizations, and donor agencies [(David, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18535/ijsrm/v6i6.sh03). The framework shows how the interests and resources of different groups are influenced by the level of economic development and the type of commodity produced, and uses the concept of "political capital" to understand how interest coalitions can influence policy outcomes [(David, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18535/ijsrm/v6i6.sh03). • **Nedergaard's Supply-Demand Model for Political Decisions**: This framework combines traditional welfare economic theory with rational choice theory to support analysis of policies like the Common Agricultural Policy [(Mokgomo et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12111760). The model considers individual decision-makers in the market as the unit of analysis at the microeconomic level, where politicians and bureaucrats supply political decisions while producers and consumers demand political decisions [(Mokgomo et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12111760). The model postulates that market failure in agricultural markets, due to intense political voice of farmers, could attract political intervention decided by equilibrium between supply of political decisions and demands of farmer-producers, consumers and taxpayers [(Mokgomo et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12111760). • **OECD Policy Paradigm Analysis Framework**: This approach uses Agricultural Policy Monitoring and Evaluation reports to examine policy paradigms through theory-led and inductive content analysis supported by coding programs like MAXQDA [(Popp, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/13876988.2019.1674623). The framework maps the adoption of policy instruments and identifies ideational frameworks by coding policy contexts, using Producer Support Estimate (PSE) levels as indicators where low PSE indicates market-liberal ideas and high PSE indicates state-assisted or multifunctional ideas [(Popp, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/13876988.2019.1674623). • **Water Management and Agricultural Production Systems Analysis**: This framework identifies components of agricultural policy through analysis of the political economy of water management and agricultural production systems [(Fragaszy et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.2458/JPE.2369). • **McKay Policy Context Framework**: This framework examines budgetary allocation, the policy landscape, and power networks in policy making including revolving door politics [(McKay et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2024.2399138). It covers a range of interventions from subsidies, taxes, trade, social protection, price supports, public pensions, credit, and land reform, recognizing that agricultural and food sectors are highly politicized due to agriculture's importance for livelihoods and food price stability [(McKay et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2024.2399138) [(Anderson et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2279384).

## Key Insights on Policy Effectiveness

**Summary:** Political economy analysis reveals that agricultural subsidies produce mixed effectiveness outcomes, with impacts varying significantly across countries, farm types, and policy designs. Research shows subsidies can both enhance and distort agricultural productivity, while their effectiveness depends heavily on local political considerations and implementation contexts rather than purely economic factors. (7 sources)

Political economy analysis has revealed complex and often contradictory insights regarding agricultural policy effectiveness. Research demonstrates that subsidies can have both positive and negative impacts on farm behavior, with positive effects occurring through wealth effects that encourage farmers to expand production in activities they would consider too risky without guaranteed income support, while negative effects emerge through distortions to production structures of receiving farms [(Vozarova et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12030948). Standard economic analysis shows that when subsidies address market failures, they increase effective producer prices above market prices, leading to supply expansion and falls in consumer prices with increases in both producer and consumer surplus, though empirical studies have found no statistically significant linear correlation between farm performance results and subsidy volumes per hectare across different legal forms [(Vozarova et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12030948). The effectiveness of agricultural subsidies varies dramatically across different political and economic contexts. Policy objectives pursued differ considerably between countries, reflecting differences in natural resource allocations, socio-economic conditions, and political considerations [(Borsellino et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12062193). While the US approach focuses on addressing price and harvest risks while ensuring affordable food access for the poorest segments, the EU emphasizes supporting income for fragmented agricultural sectors with small farms while addressing environmental challenges, and countries like India prioritize supporting small farmer livelihoods while providing cheap food access for poor consumers [(Borsellino et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12062193). Contemporary research using advanced modeling approaches has shown that subsidies play important roles in farm diversification into non-agricultural activities, which has not been completely considered in past policymaking [(Zibert et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1108/k-04-2021-0254). Simulation modeling allows researchers to test multiple policy scenarios in advance, providing concrete tools for real-world agricultural policy planning [(Zibert et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1108/k-04-2021-0254). Political economy perspectives reveal that policy effectiveness often deviates from predetermined economic outcomes because politicians determine intervention levels based on political interests rather than purely economic considerations [(Dube et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/23322039.2023.2285068). Studies of market-oriented reforms, such as China's maize purchasing and storage policy reform, demonstrate that agricultural subsidy reforms can promote green agricultural development, though with hysteresis effects [(Dube et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/23322039.2023.2285068) [(Ye et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13020251). However, research also indicates that while subsidies may safeguard food security, substantial portions often support farmers in wealthier regions, distorting agricultural growth patterns [(Dube et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/23322039.2023.2285068) [(Seitov et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.32634/0869-8155-2023-369-4-152-156). Economic experiments provide structured frameworks for understanding behavioral responses to policy interventions, helping policymakers understand behavioral drivers, test policy alternatives before implementation, and assess policy effectiveness in evaluations [(Dimitrievski et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3897/ap.e151695). These approaches generate empirical evidence that can enhance agricultural policy design and implementation by simulating real-world decision-making processes [(Dimitrievski et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3897/ap.e151695).

## Insights on Political Dynamics

**Summary:** Political economy analysis reveals that agricultural subsidies are allocated based on strategic political considerations rather than economic efficiency, with politicians targeting competitive regions and using large farms as vote brokers. The effectiveness of agricultural policies depends heavily on attributability, distributional properties, and temporal factors that influence political decision-making. (5 sources)

Political economy analysis demonstrates that agricultural subsidy allocation follows strategic political logic rather than purely economic considerations. Research using econometric methods reveals that federal and regional politicians allocate more agricultural subsidies when political competition against the dominant party is higher, supporting the "swing voters" hypothesis where governments invest resources in regions where they face more competition to achieve higher marginal returns on political investments [(Kvartiuk et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1057/s41294-020-00131-2) [(Kvartiuk et al._1, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1057/s41294-020-00131-2). Politicians appear to target large farms specifically for voter mobilization purposes, using these entities as vote brokers to influence electoral outcomes [(Kvartiuk et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1057/s41294-020-00131-2) [(Kvartiuk et al._1, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1057/s41294-020-00131-2). The political dynamics of agricultural policy are shaped by three key factors that guide policy-makers' spending decisions: attributability, distributional properties, and temporal lag. Attributability refers to the extent citizens can assess how far a policy-maker is responsible for particular policy actions and outcomes, leading policy-makers to prefer visible expenditures that can easily be connected to their decisions [(Rawat, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.af2s.2020.08.001) [(Mogues et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1111/SAJE.12076). For example, public officials in Mozambique preferred investing in large-scale irrigation schemes that were more visible over small-scale schemes despite weaker performance of the large-scale options [(Rawat, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.af2s.2020.08.001) [(Mogues et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1111/SAJE.12076). The distributional properties of public expenditure determine who benefits and the relative strength of beneficiary groups, with stronger interest groups having greater ability to influence policy decisions in their favor. Agricultural producer groups are typically more organized and have common interests compared to general citizens, enabling them to exert more influence on policy-making [(Rawat, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.af2s.2020.08.001). Analysis of stakeholder dynamics shows how ideas, interests, and influence shape policy evolution and create constraints to policy improvement, with regional governments demonstrating considerable freedom in redistribution decisions driven largely by political economy considerations [(Walls et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002410) [(Kvartiuk et al._1, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1057/s41294-020-00131-2).
