## Introduction

**Summary:** Agricultural cooperatives dominate olive oil production in Andalusia, processing 65-70% of the region's output and serving as the main economic anchor for rural municipalities. These cooperatives primarily focus on providing stability and protection for small farmers rather than market innovation or risk-taking. (3 sources)

Agricultural cooperatives play a central role in Andalusia's olive oil sector, with cooperative societies representing 48.2% of the region's mills and processing approximately 65-70% of total olive oil production [(Vicario-Modrono et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-022-02307-5) [(Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122310019) [(Parrilla-Gonzalez et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13073934). Since the second half of the 20th century, these cooperatives have formed the foundation of local economies in most small and medium-sized municipalities throughout interior Andalusia [(Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122310019). The cooperatives are particularly dominant in provinces where traditional olive groves are most common, such as Jaén, and serve as essential tools that anchor rural populations to their municipalities [(Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122310019) [(Parrilla-Gonzalez et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13073934). The cooperative model fundamentally transformed the relationship between farmers and markets by shifting producers from olive sellers to olive oil sellers [(Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122310019). However, this transformation has created a mindset where many farmers view their work as ending with product delivery to the oil mill, treating the cooperative as the market itself rather than a means to reach broader markets [(Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122310019). While cooperatives serve as elements of resilience that cushion members during critical situations and act as guarantees for local economies, their primary focus on shielding small farmers makes them inherently risk-averse structures that often perform below their potential [(Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122310019).

## Role of Cooperatives in Olive Production Governance

**Summary:** Cooperatives serve as central governance nodes in Andalusia's olive sector, controlling quality standards through payment systems and acting as key knowledge brokers between farmers and markets. They operate within hierarchical networks dominated by second-step cooperatives and regulatory boards that coordinate collective action across territories. (5 sources)

Cooperatives function as territorial development drivers and the most important business structures in Andalusian municipalities, wielding significant influence over local populations and serving as anchors for rural communities [(Parrilla-Gonzalez et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13073934). Their governance role extends beyond simple processing to active quality management through differentiated payment systems that reward higher-quality practices, such as paying more for olives picked directly from trees rather than collected from the ground, and implementing comprehensive quality indices that enable premium projects like "First Day of Harvest" [(Parrilla-Gonzalez et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13073934). The governance structure operates through a hierarchical network with three core institutions: regulatory boards, second-step cooperatives, and individual cooperatives [(Cendon et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2014124-6026). Second-step cooperatives, whose members are cooperative firms rather than individuals, focus primarily on bottling and marketing and emerge as integrating poles that concentrate advisory functions [(Cendon et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2014124-6026). These institutional hierarchies create high concentrations of decision-making power in limited numbers of actors, with some core olive oil mills gaining central roles in information dissemination across entire local agri-food systems [(Cendon et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2014124-6026). Cooperatives play a crucial dual role as both knowledge receivers and transmitters, serving as intermediaries that bring knowledge closer to farmers in isolated territories who typically lack access to new information and market opportunities [(Reina-Usuga et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land11010063). This positions them as critical nodes in knowledge networks, where information flows through dominant actors to reach end-users and improve overall network governance [(Reina-Usuga et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land11010063) [(Ngwese et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10030825). Beyond operational functions, cooperatives increasingly design new narratives and symbolic capital linked to territorial product qualification, creating olive oil networks that connect place-based identity with market positioning [(Sacchi et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE8110173).

## Power Dynamics and Institutional Hierarchy

**Summary:** Power in Andalusia's olive sector concentrates in hierarchical networks dominated by second-step cooperatives and regulatory boards, creating decision-making bottlenecks that limit individual cooperative autonomy. Despite processing 70% of regional production, cooperatives remain fragmented and "toothless" in market negotiations due to their defensive positioning and lack of interconnection. (3 sources)

The olive oil cooperative sector operates within a highly concentrated power structure where decision-making authority rests with a limited number of institutional actors [(Cendon et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2014124-6026). This hierarchy creates significant power imbalances that fundamentally shape how cooperatives function and make decisions. At the apex of this structure, second-step cooperatives emerge as dominant integrating poles, with entities like Oleoestepa in the Estepa region demonstrating exceptional influence as both the most consulted node and having the highest frequency of advisory interactions [(Cendon et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2014124-6026). Despite their collective market presence, individual cooperatives find themselves in paradoxically weak negotiating positions. Although cooperatives process 70% of Andalusia's olive oil and represent the dominant business model in traditional olive-growing provinces like Jaén, their large numbers and lack of interconnection render them "rather toothless when it comes to influencing prices" [(Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122310019). This fragmentation is compounded by management challenges, where small cooperative size results in low professionalization degrees, with some cooperatives lacking dedicated managers entirely [(Montegut et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.5539/IJBM.V6N6P16). The power dynamics create a system where farmers have minimal influence over critical commercial decisions. Farmers focus solely on delivering olives to cooperatives for predetermined prices and have no role in important processes from mill delivery through final consumer sales [(Montegut et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.5539/IJBM.V6N6P16). This exclusion from commercialization decisions reflects the defensive nature of cooperative structures, which prioritize shielding small farmers from market volatility over maximizing market influence [(Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122310019). The resulting institutional rigidity has led some innovative farmers with sufficient production capacity to consider leaving cooperatives entirely to start independent businesses, seeking greater control over their market engagement [(Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122310019).

## Impact on Farmer Decision-Making and Autonomy

**Summary:** The cooperative structure severely limits farmer autonomy by excluding them from commercialization decisions and creating a mindset where farmers view their role as ending at product delivery. This has led some innovative farmers to consider leaving cooperatives entirely to gain greater control over their businesses. (2 sources)

The cooperative system fundamentally constrains farmer decision-making by removing them from key commercial processes that affect their economic outcomes. Farmers do not actively participate in the commercialization of their product, instead focusing solely on delivering their olives to the cooperative for a predetermined price, with no role in the important issues that proceed from the time olives arrive at the cooperative until the olive oil is sold to the final consumer [(Montegut et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.5539/IJBM.V6N6P16). This exclusion from commercialization decisions raises significant questions about the value added by cooperatives and has direct ramifications for farmer incomes [(Montegut et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.5539/IJBM.V6N6P16). The cooperative business model has created a deeply ingrained mentality that further erodes farmer autonomy. Once farmers transitioned from being olive sellers to olive oil sellers through cooperatives, the idea took hold that their work ends with product delivery to the oil mill, with farmers believing that the cooperative is the market itself rather than a means to reach it [(Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122310019). This traditional conception of productive activity remains deeply rooted in cooperativism and limits farmers' engagement with broader market opportunities [(Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122310019). The restrictive nature of cooperative structures has begun driving some farmers to seek alternatives. The combination of limited decision-making power and inflexible structures that perform far below their true potential has led some of the most innovative farmers with sufficient production capacity to consider leaving the cooperative to start independent businesses [(Sanchez-Martinez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122310019). This trend suggests that the defensive, risk-averse nature of cooperatives, while providing stability for small farmers, may be incompatible with the aspirations of more entrepreneurial producers seeking greater control over their market engagement and business decisions.
