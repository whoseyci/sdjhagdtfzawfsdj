## Background and Overview of Agri-Environmental Schemes

**Summary:** Agri-environmental schemes are voluntary public programs that provide financial incentives to farmers for adopting practices that preserve or enhance environmental benefits. These market-based approaches are designed to be more attractive and less bureaucratic than traditional command-and-control environmental policies. (2 sources)

Agri-environmental schemes (AESs) represent a fundamental shift from regulatory approaches to market-based environmental policy instruments. These programs are public economic instruments that provide payments, technical transfer, or extension support to farmers for environmental commitments related to preserving or enhancing agri-environmental practices [(Zaga-Mendez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5334/ijc.1002). The voluntary nature of these schemes is considered more attractive, decentralized, and less bureaucratic than traditional command and control policies, thereby encouraging greater engagement from agricultural producers [(Zaga-Mendez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5334/ijc.1002). AESs are closely related to payments for ecosystem services (PES), which are conceived as financial transactions between providers and users of ecosystem services to enhance ecological conservation. These payment mechanisms are promoted to complement state-centered incentives for the provision of ecosystem services from agricultural landscapes by establishing appropriate pricing based on the opportunity costs of potential ecosystem service providers [(Zaga-Mendez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5334/ijc.1002). In developed regions such as Europe, agri-environmental management strategies are commonly supported by payment schemes that allow farmers to receive compensation for undertaking environmental measures on their farmland [(Mfune, 2013)](https://doi.org/10.5539/JSD.V7N1P46). The success of these incentive programs is typically evaluated through analyses focused on the economic performance of the payments and the effectiveness of environmental outcomes [(Zaga-Mendez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5334/ijc.1002). This dual focus on economic efficiency and environmental effectiveness forms the foundation for understanding how payment design and adequacy influence farmer participation and behavioral responses in agri-environmental schemes.

## Payment Design Mechanisms and Approaches

**Summary:** Agri-environmental payment schemes use two main approaches: action-based payments that compensate farmers for adopting specific practices regardless of outcomes, and results-based payments that tie compensation to achieving measurable environmental results. While action-based schemes offer certainty to farmers, results-based approaches provide better value for money by linking payments directly to environmental performance. (8 sources)

The design of payment mechanisms in agri-environmental schemes centers on two fundamental approaches that differ in how they link compensation to environmental outcomes. **Action-based payment schemes** offer farmers typically uniform payments for adopting defined management practices, with compensation calculated based on estimated average opportunity costs and usually uniform for all participants in the program [(Amdur et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-011-9655-y) [(Simpson et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106688). At their core, these schemes aim to compensate land managers for the additional costs and income foregone incurred in farming with higher environmental and ecological quality standards [(Simpson et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106688). In contrast, **results-based payment schemes** tie compensation directly to environmental outcomes achieved. These approaches define an objective and offer payment related to the degree to which the objective has been attained, with payment rates linked to the level of ecosystem service supply - the higher the level of supply, the higher the payment [(Delaby et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2020.543587). Results-based payments employ field scoring systems which generate data that help determine where positive environmental impacts are occurring, allowing farmers greater freedom to decide how to manage their land and use their skill and experience to improve environmental and agricultural performance [(Mcdonagh, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su14095569). A key limitation of action-based schemes is that payments do not reflect the spatial heterogeneity in economic costs and potential ecological benefits, which significantly hinders cost-effectiveness in achieving ecological targets [(Simpson et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106688). However, results-based schemes transfer risk from the government to farmers, since farmers cannot be sure that particular actions will deliver particular results, potentially leading to lower participation rates [(Simpson et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106688). Beyond these basic approaches, payment design increasingly incorporates **differentiated payment mechanisms** to improve cost-effectiveness. Many schemes based on fixed pricing rules are considered to have overpaid farmers because of inadequate analysis of supply-demand dynamics, leading to advocacy for conservation auctions as a mechanism for addressing such challenges [(Juvancic et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11030846). Research suggests that differentiated incentive payments that more accurately reflect farmers' true opportunity costs could provide more cost-effective alternatives to uniform payment structures [(Juvancic et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11030846). Payment design also varies in addressing **transaction costs and administrative burden**. Including fixed amounts per contract can have positive effects for small farms where transaction costs would outweigh the difference between payment and opportunity cost [(Beltran-Esteve et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2012104-3088). However, low administrative workload and inadequate payment levels often make schemes insufficiently attractive for farmers, leading to low participation levels [(Delaby et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2020.543587). The evolution toward more sophisticated payment mechanisms reflects growing recognition that effective scheme design must account for heterogeneous farmer costs, environmental indicators that accurately measure target outcomes, and the need to balance administrative feasibility with environmental effectiveness [(Gloux et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2022-22766) [(Amancah et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.17268/sci.agropecu.2023.038).

## Payment Adequacy and Threshold Effects

**Summary:** Payment adequacy in agri-environmental schemes requires balancing compensation levels to avoid both underprovision from insufficient payments and inefficient overcompensation that limits program reach. Research shows substantial variation in farmers' willingness to accept payments, with participation rates highly sensitive to payment levels and scheme requirements. (8 sources)

The adequacy of payment levels in agri-environmental schemes is fundamentally constrained by welfare economic principles and practical budget limitations. From a welfare economic perspective, efficient compensation should remunerate farmers based on the marginal social value of environmental benefits to avoid underprovision of environmental public goods. However, if payments significantly exceed opportunity costs (overcompensation), underprovision may still result because scheme funds are limited and more farmers could be enrolled if payments were lower (Bartkowski et al., 2019). **Evidence of overcompensation** is documented across multiple contexts. Many schemes based on fixed pricing rules are considered to have overpaid farmers because of inadequate analysis of supply-demand dynamics, leading to advocacy for conservation auctions as a mechanism for addressing such challenges [(Juvancic et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11030846). The Finnish agri-environmental program demonstrates this problem, having been very generous with large overcompensation, keeping low profit farms and marginal lands in production, and actually increasing nutrient loading [(Ollikainen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-019-01264-0). **Substantial heterogeneity in payment requirements** creates challenges for uniform payment structures. Research on animal genetic resource conservation found that farmers' willingness to accept conservation support differs significantly from actual payment levels, with estimated required payments being 27% lower for local sheep and goat breeds and 5% higher for local pig breeds than current payment rates [(Juvancic et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11030846). Similarly, analysis of opportunity costs in Spanish agri-environmental schemes found great diversity among farms, leading researchers to recommend auction systems to award environmental contracts rather than fixed payments [(Beltran-Esteve et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2012104-3088). **Participation sensitivity to payment levels** varies significantly based on scheme requirements. Analysis of different agri-environmental scenarios showed that participation rates changed substantially depending on payment levels and scheme stringency. At €150/ha payment levels, participation ranged from 15% to 66% of farmers depending on the specific requirements, with more stringent schemes showing less sensitivity to payment increases [(Villanueva et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2015134-7376). For the most demanding schemes, participation rates reached only 38% even at €400/ha payment levels [(Villanueva et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2015134-7376). **Transaction costs create minimum payment thresholds** particularly for smaller operations. For small farms or farmers unfamiliar with agri-environmental proceedings, transaction costs can outweigh the difference between payments and opportunity costs, suggesting that including fixed amounts per contract could have positive effects [(Beltran-Esteve et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2012104-3088). Payment levels must account for both opportunity and transaction costs that farmers incur when entering voluntary schemes [(Hejnowicz et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2016.04.005). **Inadequate payment levels** represent a significant barrier to scheme effectiveness. Research indicates that insufficient incentives limit uptake of conservation agreements, suggesting that higher payments may achieve greater environmental benefits through increased participation rates [(Stewart et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/csp2.12795). Advisors have noted that recent payment reductions have made some schemes non-viable for farmers, with annual returns too low to justify participation [(Hejnowicz et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2016.04.005). The challenge of payment adequacy is further complicated by **budget transfer mechanisms** between different support types. Research using French farm data found that transferring budgets from income support to environmental incentives can increase adoption, but the effects on participation probabilities and acceptable payment levels vary depending on the type of environmental contract, direct payment type, and farm orientation [(Gloux et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.36253/bae-14414).

## Farmer Behavioral Responses to Payment Incentives

**Summary:** Farmer participation in agri-environmental schemes is driven by multiple behavioral factors beyond payment levels, including risk preferences, social recognition, contract flexibility, and administrative burden. Farmers show heterogeneous responses based on farm characteristics and personal motivations, with participation declining as scheme requirements become more stringent regardless of payment increases. (10 sources)

Research reveals that farmer behavioral responses to agri-environmental payment incentives extend far beyond simple economic calculations. The agri-economic literature highlights the positive effects of incentive mechanisms in increasing farmer participation, with market and climate-condition uncertainties serving as additional drivers of scheme adoption [(Bartolini et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11102753). However, participation patterns show significant heterogeneity even within similar payment structures, as demonstrated in Dutch case studies where only 10 out of 44 respondents engaged in agri-environmental schemes, with most participating farmers maintaining three or more different contracts [(Hauser et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.16993/RL.14). **Risk preferences fundamentally shape farmer responses** to different payment structures. On account of risk-averse behavior, farmers tend to prefer to receive lower, but certain payments rather than uncertain income, even if it were to be higher [(Bartolini et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU11102753). This risk sensitivity becomes particularly pronounced in results-based schemes, where non-participation is associated with high perceived bureaucratic burden and scheme risk, while risk-seeking farmers are more likely to participate in these uncertain payment structures [(Muzzillo et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1093/qopen/qoae026). **Contract design features significantly influence participation decisions** beyond payment levels alone. Farmers require greater financial incentives to join schemes with longer contracts, or those that offer less flexibility or higher levels of paperwork [(Tankosic et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su151612476). The analysis shows that farmers are willing to participate for lower compensation in programs that allow for the maintenance of agricultural activity and do not impose stringent restrictions on farm management [(Tankosic et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su151612476). **Social preferences and non-monetary incentives** play an increasingly recognized role in farmer behavior. Research demonstrates that farmers are willing to give up economic rents for more publicity of their conservation activities, with public recognition of environmental activity worth £3.85 per hectare to farmers on average [(Banerjee et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10640-020-00529-7). A regulator can ensure better environmental outcomes at lower cost by exploiting farmers' social preferences and offering non-monetary incentives, with green farmers responding to facilitation services and social rewards while brown farmers require monetary incentives [(Banerjee et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10640-020-00529-7). **Participation sensitivity varies systematically with scheme stringency**. The more stringent the agri-environmental scheme requirements, the less sensitive farmers are to payment increases, with participation rates in the most stringent schemes reaching only 38% even at €400/ha payment levels compared to 46-80% participation in less demanding scenarios [(Villanueva et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2015134-7376). This pattern suggests that behavioral barriers beyond compensation become increasingly important as environmental requirements intensify. **Social networks and subjective norms** influence adoption decisions, with the opinions of fellow farmers and the farming community playing crucial roles in participation decisions [(Eichhorn et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2024.2364774). Economic, legal, and social factors are the most influential determinants of participation, with fair payment, clear contract design, and social relations being the most commonly mentioned factors [(Eichhorn et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.36253/bae-14489). **Innovative contract designs** are emerging to address diverse farmer preferences and behavioral responses. Enhanced incentives for sustainable land management have led to development of results-based contracts, collective action contracts, value chain contracts, and land tenure contracts, though barriers to adoption arise in terms of how farmers perceive the benefits [(Bradfield et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-024-02027-8). These innovations recognize that continued innovation in contract design may make agri-environmental schemes more effective, but must account for farmer behavioral heterogeneity in risk tolerance, social motivation, and operational constraints [(Gloux et al._1, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2024.2303738).

## Factors Affecting Payment Effectiveness

**Summary:** Payment effectiveness in agri-environmental schemes depends on multiple interconnected factors including scheme design complexity, administrative burden, environmental ambition versus participation trade-offs, and the ability to adapt to dynamic conditions. Success requires balancing cost-effectiveness with environmental outcomes while accounting for farmer preferences and operational constraints. (8 sources)

The effectiveness of payment mechanisms in agri-environmental schemes is constrained by fundamental trade-offs between environmental ambition and farmer participation. **Designing efficient payment mechanisms for public good provision involves trade-offs between environmental ambition and wide acceptance by farmers**, with conditionality rules needing to define environmental services with sufficient effort to achieve environmental objectives while remaining attractive enough to ensure significant participation [(Gloux et al._1, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2024.2303738). Research shows that **major reasons for slow progress in nutrient abatement include current policy instruments that are not cost-effective and are sometimes insensitive to trade-offs between environmental targets** [(Ollikainen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-019-01264-0). **Scheme design and implementation processes play crucial roles** in determining payment effectiveness. The concrete design and implementation process of agri-environmental measures are fundamental factors for their successful application, with **key factors influencing farmer participation including fair payments, lower household dependency on agricultural incomes, age and education levels, presence of a successor, and changes not directly connected with agri-environmental schemes** [(Tankosic et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su151612476). **Administrative burden and transaction costs significantly impact effectiveness**, particularly affecting smaller operations and those unfamiliar with scheme procedures. For small farms or farmers not used to such proceedings, **transaction costs can outweigh the difference between payments and opportunity costs, suggesting that including fixed amounts per contract could have positive effects** [(Beltran-Esteve et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2012104-3088). Results-based schemes face particular challenges, as **non-participation is associated with high perceived bureaucratic burden, with scheme risk decreasing the likelihood of enrollment while risk-seeking farmers are more likely to participate** [(Muzzillo et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1093/qopen/qoae026). **Payment adequacy must account for evolving market conditions and budget constraints**. Advisors have noted that **recent payment reductions have made some schemes non-viable for farmers, with annual returns too low to justify participation** [(Hejnowicz et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2016.04.005). However, schemes can become ineffective through overcompensation, as demonstrated in Finland where **the agri-environmental program has been very generous, providing large overcompensation, keeping low profit farms and marginal lands in production, and actually increasing nutrient loading** [(Ollikainen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-019-01264-0). **Flexibility and adaptability are essential for long-term effectiveness**, particularly in dynamic agricultural and environmental contexts. Working lands payment schemes face challenges from **variable weather patterns that alter timing of conservation targets year-to-year, creating dynamic and unpredictable targets**, requiring **schemes to adopt design elements that can add flexibility, such as cancellation clauses, so they can adjust to dynamic targets and adapt to changing agricultural-wildlife relationships** [(Laney, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1111/csp2.12955). **Cost-effectiveness can be improved through differentiated payment mechanisms** that better reflect spatial and temporal heterogeneity in costs and benefits. Research suggests that **auction systems would be more effective than fixed payments per hectare, given large differences in compensation required by farms**, which would **maximize effectiveness either through larger participation for given financial resources or lower costs for given farmland coverage** [(Beltran-Esteve et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.5424/SJAR/2012104-3088). **Sustainability challenges** persist across different payment approaches, including **asymmetry of information in decision making, prospects of farmer willingness to participate, inclusion of transaction costs, uncertainty of property rights, collective coordination, and lack of incentives for business connections** [(Amancah et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.17268/sci.agropecu.2023.038). These challenges highlight that payment effectiveness requires comprehensive approaches addressing multiple barriers beyond compensation levels alone.
