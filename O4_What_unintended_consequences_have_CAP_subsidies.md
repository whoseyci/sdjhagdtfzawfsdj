**Research Query:** O.4 What unintended consequences have CAP subsidies created that prevent the adoption of environmentally beneficial practices?

---

## Background and Context

**Summary:** The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was created to boost food production and farm incomes after World War II, but its design focuses on output and area-based payments rather than environmental outcomes. This structure has created deep conflicts between agricultural productivity goals and environmental protection that persist today. (LLM Memory)

The European Union's Common Agricultural Policy emerged in the post-war era with clear objectives: ensure food security, stabilize agricultural markets, and provide reasonable incomes for farmers . The policy framework was built around production subsidies and later evolved into area-based payments, but environmental considerations were largely absent from its original design . This foundation created a system that rewards farmers primarily for land ownership and production volume rather than environmental stewardship . The CAP's structure reflects a fundamental tension between its economic origins and the growing need for sustainable farming practices, as the policy continues to channel billions of euros annually through mechanisms that were not designed with environmental outcomes in mind . This disconnect between the CAP's institutional framework and modern environmental challenges has created systematic barriers to adopting practices that would benefit biodiversity, soil health, and climate resilience .

## Structural Contradictions within CAP Policy

**Summary:** The CAP contains built-in contradictions where its first pillar promotes intensive farming that harms the environment while its second pillar tries to encourage environmental practices. These opposing forces within the same policy framework create systematic barriers to sustainable farming adoption. (2 sources)

The CAP's two-pillar structure creates fundamental internal contradictions that undermine environmental goals. The first pillar favors intensive and productive agriculture, which fragments natural habitats, while the second pillar simultaneously tries to incentivize farmers to develop environmentally friendly practices [(Navarro et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-12039-3_11). This structural contradiction means farmers receive conflicting signals from the same policy framework, with the larger financial incentives typically favoring intensive practices over environmental stewardship. The policy's original focus on maximum production has created a system where what works appropriately in one region produces harmful consequences in another. Support mechanisms designed for small farmers in Southern France and Germany led to undesirable environmental consequences for large farms in Northern France and Southern UK, where they enabled highly mechanized monoculture production [(Orskov, 2002)](https://doi.org/10.22358/JAFS/67908/2002). Similarly, appropriate animal subsidies in some areas resulted in overgrazing problems in others, while crop subsidies became so distorted that harvesting was sometimes unnecessary [(Orskov, 2002)](https://doi.org/10.22358/JAFS/67908/2002). The disconnect between subsidy spending and environmental outcomes reveals the depth of these structural problems. There is no direct relationship between the amount spent on CAP subsidies per hectare and the level of High Nature Value Farmland in an area [(Navarro et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-12039-3_11). Even compensations paid to farmers in Least Favored Areas, supposedly designed to prevent farmland abandonment, place no real limits on intensification and overgrazing as long as farmers follow loosely defined "good farming practices" [(Navarro et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-12039-3_11).

## Support for Intensive and Industrial Farming Practices

**Summary:** CAP subsidies disproportionately benefit large-scale industrial farms over smaller traditional operations, creating market distortions that favor capital and energy-intensive production methods. This bias against labor-intensive sustainable practices has led to widespread environmental degradation and marginalization of the small farms that historically maintained Europe's agricultural biodiversity. (8 sources)

The CAP's subsidy structure systematically favors corporate and industrial farming operations over traditional European agricultural practices. These subsidies end up supporting "corporate farms" that are almost always prone to intensive and industrial forms of agriculture, fundamentally different from those that have traditionally characterized the European agricultural landscape [(Borsellino et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12062193) [(Slamova et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su11215966). This shift has gradually marginalized medium and especially small farms, which have always represented the majority in terms of spread and workforce in the EU, compromising the economic, social and environmental sustainability of the entire sector [(Borsellino et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12062193). Current subsidies have created severe distortions in production costs that actively work against sustainable farming practices. The policy has led to "a very strong distortion of the relative costs of production factors in favour of surface, energy and capital intensity and against labour" [(Peeters et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3220/LBF1610123299000). This is particularly problematic because agricultural practices compatible with environmental protection, climate action, and local food systems are typically more labor-intensive [(Peeters et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3220/LBF1610123299000). The result is a counterproductive policy that subsidizes most factors of production except the most crucial one for sustainable practices: human labor. The subsidies also promote environmentally harmful production patterns through their support for resource-intensive livestock operations. Direct payments excessively subsidize dairy and meat production, which are associated with high levels of resource consumption and environmental impacts [(Cuadros-Casanova et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.14052). These incentives indirectly promote higher demand for livestock feeds like soy, with about 97% of EU soy requirements imported in 2020, and 72% coming from biodiversity-rich South American countries, contributing to deforestation [(Cuadros-Casanova et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.14052). Additionally, there are concerns that stimulating capital investment under the CAP encourages industrial livestock farming and leads to excessive investments [(Tsiouni et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137441) [(Chandel et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.33785/IJDS.2019.V72I02.001). The policy's industrial bias extends to crop production through its continued support for synthetic input-intensive farming. The legislation subsidizes farmers making extensive use of synthetic inputs without adequately supporting organic production, hindering the transition toward sustainable practices [(Cuadros-Casanova et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.14052). This approach has historically encouraged process innovation aimed at higher agricultural productivity "without any respect for the soil and other natural resources," generating overproduction and environmental damage with serious consequences for future generations [(Aronica et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21681376.2023.2225569). Even where environmental standards formally exist, they are often not applicable to small and medium farms and are significantly lower than initially planned for large operators, meaning incentives for boosting production efficiency and intensity continue to prevail [(Karol, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.17306/J.JARD.2017.00295).

## Market Distortions and Economic Inefficiencies

**Summary:** CAP subsidies create widespread market distortions by promoting overproduction, artificially inflating land prices, and encouraging inefficient farming practices. These economic inefficiencies actively work against environmental goals by reducing farmers' incentives to adopt sustainable practices and creating dependencies on unsustainable production methods. (7 sources)

The CAP's subsidy structure generates significant market distortions that undermine both economic efficiency and environmental sustainability. Subsidies often distort farmers' investment decisions toward relatively less productive activities that are supported by subsidies, leading them to overinvest in subsidized inputs and reducing their willingness to adopt cost-optimizing strategies [(Bernini et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2024.108120). These distortions manifest in various ways, including market price distortions that lead to inefficiencies and over-reliance on intensive farming practices [(Isabella, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.47604/jlp.v2i1.2111). The current area-based payment system creates particularly problematic economic distortions that work against environmental goals. Area payments have little dependence on reductions in environmentally harmful chemicals or over-intense agricultural production [(Czyzewski et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.35808/ersj/1491). Moreover, although direct payments were intended to improve farmers' economic situations, they are largely transferred through increased rental prices to landowners who are not professionally active in agriculture but merely lease their land [(Czyzewski et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.35808/ersj/1491). This transfer mechanism means subsidies fail to reach their intended beneficiaries while inflating land costs. The subsidy system creates inefficiencies that delay the transition to sustainable practices. Current CAP policies allocate the major part of funds according to earlier payments during a reference period or the number of hectares, thereby delaying progression toward more sustainable farming practices [(Henriksen et al., 2011)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-04176-160422). The general farm input subsidy contributes to inefficient manufacturing, variable quality, and excessive and poorly managed use by farmers [(Smith, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.15302/j-fase-2019290). These poorly designed subsidies create unintended consequences, such as farmer dependency, fiscal strain, and market distortion [(Dong et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-06997-5). The decoupled payment system, while intended to reduce production distortions, has created new problems that harm environmental outcomes. Decoupled payments have been criticized because the current subsidy system hurts small farms and poor farmers through reverse distribution, which is harmful for social cohesion and environmental protection [(Cong et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0041225). These irrational transfer payments are decoupled from actual performance and may be negative for environmental protection [(Cong et al., 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0041225). Research shows that environmental measures positively affect farmers' environmental efficiency but negatively impact their economic efficiency levels, creating a trade-off that discourages adoption of sustainable practices [(Bernini et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2024.108120).

## Barriers to Sustainable Practice Adoption

**Summary:** CAP creates multiple specific barriers that actively prevent farmers from adopting sustainable practices, including subsidies that reward chemical-intensive farming, insurance programs that encourage risky behavior, bureaucratic requirements that exclude sustainable systems, and payment structures that ignore environmental benefits. (11 sources)

The CAP's subsidy structure creates several direct barriers that prevent farmers from adopting environmentally beneficial practices: • **Subsidies promote harmful chemical inputs**: Farm subsidy programs often stimulate greater use of chemical inputs, despite their environmental and public health harms, while failing to reward good stewardship practices [(Horrigan et al., 2002)](https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP.02110445). Input subsidy programs are negatively associated with smallholders' adoption of environmentally friendly and sustainable pest management strategies, encouraging synthetic pesticide use at the expense of sustainable practices [(Tambo et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1477-9552.12582) [(Midingoyi et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1477-9552.12306). • **Insurance programs encourage risky behavior**: Subsidized crop insurance policies result in expansion of agriculture on marginal quality land that is economically inferior and environmentally vulnerable [(Mukherjee et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/346139). Extending insurance instruments without requiring proper risk mitigation measures can promote unsustainable, risk-prone behavior by allowing farmers to disregard avoidable risks [(Pe'er et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1002/pan3.10080). • **Payment systems ignore environmental practices**: Current CAP payments are not linked to any cropping system, soil management protocol, or scheme that offers payment for environmental services [(Choden et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13052726) [(Pineiro et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-020-00617-y). The system emphasizes a handful of major crops and puts resource-conserving crop rotations at a financial disadvantage, with farmers receiving no government incentives for sustainable practices like growing clover or alfalfa to enhance soil fertility [(Horrigan et al., 2002)](https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP.02110445). • **Bureaucratic exclusions of sustainable systems**: Narrow inclusion criteria discriminate against sustainable farming methods, with measures for Ecological Focus Areas excluding over 48% of the farmed EU area due to minimum land area requirements [(Adams et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-024-10595-y) [(Burgess et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-018-0261-3). In Germany, agroforestry uptake was constrained by bureaucracy requiring farmers to divide fields into areas with and without trees, complicating applications for Pillar I payments [(Adams et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-024-10595-y) [(Burgess et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-018-0261-3). • **Inadequate financial support for transitions**: Financial incentives such as fertilizer taxes and subsidies to sustainable production systems have shown little or no effect in changing crop production practices [(Adusumilli et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3390/RESOURCES3040721). Unattractive conditions, great bureaucratic loads, insufficient advice, and low payments that do not adequately compensate farmers create barriers to uptake of environmentally friendly practices [(Adams et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-024-10595-y) [(Jitea et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRICULTURE11030235). • **Limited scope of existing incentives**: Pillar I and II incentives only support establishing new agroforestry systems, not improving existing ones, and market-based incentives promote some practices like intercropping but not others like no-tillage adoption [(Choden et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13052726) [(Pineiro et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-020-00617-y). These incentives also fail to account for households' short-term economic needs [(Choden et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13052726) [(Pineiro et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-020-00617-y).

## Inadequate Environmental Standards and Enforcement

**Summary:** The CAP's environmental standards are extremely weak, with greening requirements affecting only 1% of EU farmland and showing no real environmental benefits. Even when environmental subsidies exist, they often have negative effects and fail to achieve their stated goals due to poor design and inadequate enforcement. (5 sources)

The CAP's environmental standards are fundamentally inadequate in both scope and effectiveness. The introduction of greening requirements meant that only 1% of UAA in the EU required land diversification and around 1% of UAA required the introduction of ecological focus areas [(Biernat-Jarka, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.22630/PEFIM.2019.22.71.22). Research has shown that the introduction of greening payments under the EU CAP has not increased the area allocated to areas that are beneficial from the environmental and climate point of view [(Biernat-Jarka, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.22630/PEFIM.2019.22.71.22). This minimal coverage demonstrates how the policy's environmental requirements affect only a tiny fraction of EU agricultural land while leaving the vast majority of farming operations unchanged. Even where environmental subsidies exist, they often produce contradictory or negative outcomes. Environmental subsidies contribute to the sustainable development of agriculture in theory, but in practice there is concern that stimulating capital endowment under the CAP fosters industrial agriculture and may lead to excessive investment [(Czyzewski et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-020-00834-6). More troublingly, except for cross-sectional impacts, environmental payments actually exert a negative effect on ecosystem service values [(Czyzewski et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-020-00834-6). This finding suggests that current environmental subsidies may be counterproductive, harming rather than helping environmental outcomes. The overall assessment of CAP environmental performance reveals systematic policy failure. Research estimates that subsidies in the CAP supported high-pollution practices in agriculture and low nature-value farmland, as well as increasing income inequality [(Arneth et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-environ-012320-054809). A critical examination of the previous CAP's impact reveals a mixed record in achieving environmental objectives, underscoring the complexity of factors influencing farmers' decisions and indicating that economic incentives alone may not guarantee widespread adoption of sustainable practices [(Paris et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14786451.2024.2326454) [(Dessart et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ERAE/JBZ019). This poor track record demonstrates that the CAP's environmental standards and enforcement mechanisms are insufficient to drive meaningful change toward sustainable farming practices.
