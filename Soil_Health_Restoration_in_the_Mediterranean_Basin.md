## Background

**Summary:** Mediterranean agricultural systems in Spain face a complex challenge where traditional sustainable practices have been replaced by intensive, short-term profit-focused approaches that degrade soil health, while climate change and economic pressures create additional barriers to restoration efforts. (8 sources)

The Mediterranean basin, particularly Spain, presents a paradoxical situation for soil health restoration. While the region benefits from mild temperatures and abundant sunshine, it faces fundamental constraints including poor soils, limited rainfall, and intensifying climate change impacts, with water being the principal limiting factor [(Aznar-Sanchez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10040506). Historically, millennia-old traditional tillage practices and irrigation systems were sustainable from erosion and water resource perspectives, even though they depleted organic matter content [(Keesstra et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND7040133). However, a critical transition has occurred driven by new drip irrigation technology combined with European and national subsidies that promoted conversion to no-tillage systems. This shift persuaded many farmers to use herbicides instead of ploughing, which paradoxically increased sediment yield and polluted soil and water resources [(Keesstra et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND7040133). The current land management strategy focuses solely on short-term profit maximization without utilizing soil functions, thereby damaging physical, chemical, and biological soil processes [(Keesstra et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND7040133). The agricultural landscape is dominated by small-sized farms, which are more susceptible to climate change and economic variation due to limited funds and capacity to invest compared to larger enterprises [(Costa et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2019.01125). These small farms face additional pressures from increased urbanization, excessive land fragmentation, and shortage of natural resources, contributing to increased vulnerability across Mediterranean countries [(Costa et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2019.01125). Climate change compounds these challenges significantly. Rising temperatures accelerate the decomposition of organic matter in soil, with the Mediterranean region showing alarmingly low soil organic carbon levels [(Doyeni et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy14123024). Soil loss in olive groves reaches between 29 and 47 tonnes per hectare per year on average, with some areas exceeding 100 tonnes, leading to soil degradation, reduced water retention capacity, and emergence of badlands [(Fuentes et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11030412). Traditional agricultural systems operated by smallholders have historically represented effective land use for sustainable natural resource management, but many have either abandoned agriculture entirely, adapted to more intensive systems, or maintained only limited aspects of traditional cultivation [(Biasi et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13073967) [(Moresi et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/geosciences10080309). Despite evidence that extensive cultivation performs better than intensive systems or abandonment in terms of soil quality, the transition toward sustainable practices remains limited [(Biasi et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13073967). The low profitability and competitiveness of agricultural productions drive abandonment of traditional crops and rural depopulation, particularly affecting Mediterranean woody crops like olive, almond, and citrus that face problems of relatively low productivity and profitability [(Calatrava et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11050821). However, emerging integrated systems that combine traditional and new technologies, such as almond orchards with sheep production using cover crops, demonstrate potential pathways that can fertilize soil, sequester carbon, protect against erosion, enhance water quality, and support biodiversity while inspiring younger farmers to form new farming communities [(Keesstra et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND7040133).

## Bio-physical and Climate Constraints

**Summary:** Water scarcity is the primary limiting factor for soil health restoration in Mediterranean Spain, where competition between cover crops and main crops for water resources creates a fundamental barrier, while degraded soils, extreme weather events, and accelerating climate change compound these challenges. (6 sources)

Water represents the principal limiting factor for agricultural activities in the Mediterranean basin, despite advantages like mild temperatures and abundant sunshine [(Aznar-Sanchez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10040506). The rivalry between cover crops and olive groves for available water creates one of the most significant barriers to implementing sustainable soil practices, as water consumption by cover crops during dry periods can reduce resource availability for olive trees and potentially decline crop yields [(Aznar-Sanchez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10040506). This competition is particularly problematic in rain-fed orchards, where the establishment of cover crops raises serious agro-economic concerns [(Carpio et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY10091412). The Mediterranean climate presents additional physical constraints with very hot and dry summers, high inter-annual and intra-annual rainfall variability, frequent droughts, and intense rainfall events [(Rodriguez-Lizana et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10071041). While olive trees are well-adapted to these conditions and traditionally cultivated in marginal areas with low fertility, steep slopes, and shallow soils, farmers typically control weeds through tillage to prevent competition for nutrients, which accelerates soil organic matter losses and increases erosion [(Rodriguez-Lizana et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10071041). Soil degradation compounds these water-related challenges significantly. Highly degraded soils affected by compaction, poor fertility, and loss of seed banks make it extremely difficult to establish effective herbaceous cover that can reduce water erosion [(Carpio et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY10091412). Soil loss in olive groves averages between 29 and 47 tonnes per hectare per year, with some areas exceeding 100 tonnes, leading to degradation, reduced water retention capacity, and emergence of badlands [(Fuentes et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11030412). Climate change accelerates these constraints by increasing temperatures that speed up decomposition of organic matter in soil, with Mediterranean regions showing alarmingly low soil organic carbon levels [(Doyeni et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy14123024). The gradual temperature rise serves as the dominant factor behind soil organic carbon decline when suitable agricultural management is not deployed [(Doyeni et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy14123024). Additionally, global warming increases the frequency of torrential rainfall events that cause severe loss of unprotected soils [(Fuentes et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11030412). These bio-physical constraints create a perception barrier where farmers view cover crops as a cause of yield reduction due to nutrient and water competition, making them reluctant to adopt these practices despite their potential benefits [(Puig-Sirera et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13040716). The selection of cover crops also implies additional risks related to pest and disease occurrence, while farm characteristics like small size and challenging topography further limit implementation options [(Aznar-Sanchez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10040506).

## Socio-economic Constraints and Inertia

**Summary:** The agricultural system's dependence on subsidies combined with farmers' unwillingness to change traditional practices creates strong inertia, while small farm sizes, limited financial capacity, and focus on short-term profits prevent adoption of sustainable soil management despite potential long-term benefits. (8 sources)

The Mediterranean agricultural system exhibits profound structural inertia rooted in economic dependencies and farmer behavior. The system strongly depends on agri-environmental subsidies, with only 5% of land users implementing sustainable practices like green manure voluntarily [(Marques et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU8020177). Barriers to adoption are not biophysical but center on the lack of willingness of farmers to change their traditional practices, while circumstances such as poverty, weak policies, or inefficient scientific knowledge transmission hinder effective upscaling of land restoration [(Marques et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU8020177). The dominance of small-sized farms in Mediterranean countries creates additional systemic constraints. Small agricultural operations are more susceptible to climate change and prone to economic variation due to limited funds and capacity to invest compared to larger enterprises [(Costa et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2019.01125). These farms face compounding pressures from increased urbanization, excessive land fragmentation, climate change, and shortage of natural resources, contributing to increased vulnerability across the Mediterranean region [(Costa et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2019.01125). Current land management strategies reflect a fundamental misalignment between short-term economic pressures and long-term sustainability goals. The chosen land management focuses solely on making more profit in the short term without utilizing soil functions, thereby damaging physical, chemical, and biological soil processes [(Keesstra et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND7040133). The characteristics of the agricultural sector, price volatility, and dependence on external conditions like climate mean many farmers operate with very small profit margins, limiting their access to sustainable technologies [(Aznar-Sanchez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10040506). Economic constraints drive broader systemic changes that perpetuate soil degradation. Low profitability and competitiveness of agricultural productions serve as major drivers of traditional crop abandonment and resulting rural depopulation, with Mediterranean woody crops like olive, almond, and citrus facing problems of relatively low productivity and profitability [(Calatrava et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11050821). The mechanization of farming activities and use of agrochemicals promoted through governmental subsidies resulted in abandonment of soil and water conservation structures, replacement of cereals with woody perennial crops, and intensification of tillage activities [(Tittonell et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2022.844261). Knowledge and perception barriers compound these economic constraints. Farmers often lack empirical data showing the effectiveness of sustainable practices, and the generally slow response of soils to management changes in semiarid conditions delays visible results, discouraging adoption [(Soto et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5751/es-12796-260429). Principal barriers include lack of information on practices, absence of systems to control legal regulation fulfillment, implementation and maintenance costs, cultural aspects, uncertainty regarding risk, and disadvantages related to farm size [(Aznar-Sanchez et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10040506). Cultural and operational factors create additional resistance to change. In Mediterranean cropping systems, one major factor explaining lack of adoption is the grazing of crop residues by livestock, as harvested lands are considered openly accessible and smallholder landowners have no control over transient herds [(Cicek et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-023-00926-4). Small farm size and resulting low ownership of agricultural machinery represent strong drivers, while intellectual and cultural misconceptions about soil management appear as prominent causes of low adoption [(Cicek et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-023-00926-4).

## Cultural and Perceptual Stabilizers

**Summary:** Deep-rooted cultural perceptions about "good farming" practices, traditional attachments to tillage as a symbol of competence, and farmers' sense of powerlessness against soil degradation create strong psychological barriers that stabilize current unsustainable practices despite scientific evidence of their harm. (4 sources)

Cultural perceptions about soil management fundamentally shape farmers' understanding and decision-making, often influencing adoption of conservation practices even more than concrete realities [(Topp et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335083). These deeply held beliefs create a perception where soil degradation may appear to farmers as an undesirable natural side effect that they are powerless to counteract [(Topp et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335083). The symbolic importance of traditional farming practices represents one of the strongest stabilizing forces. Conservation agriculture practices may be rejected by farmers because they do not produce commonly acknowledged symbols of "good farming" that have contributed to the formation of farmers' identities [(Topp et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335083). Intensive tillage serves as a central feature of agricultural management in the Mediterranean, where traditional and smallholder farming remains the norm, with the plough symbolizing tradition and having sustained yields for centuries [(Topp et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335083). These symbols align with productivist values, such as maintaining a tidy farm appearance through straight-lined and weed-free crops, leading farmers to feel that reducing tillage under conservation agriculture may result in them being judged as untidy, incompetent, or inefficient [(Topp et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335083). Conventional farmers consider tillage alongside fertilization as central soil management practices, a perception that contrasts with scientific evidence showing repetitive tillage has negative impacts on long-term soil functions and properties in the Mediterranean [(Topp et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2024.2335083). Intellectual and cultural misconceptions about soil management appear as prominent causes of low adoption of sustainable practices, suggesting that conservation agriculture promotion efforts are rarely adapted to the contextual circumstances of Mediterranean smallholders [(Cicek et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-023-00926-4). The fundamental barrier centers on farmers' lack of willingness to change their traditional practices, with circumstances such as poverty, weak policies, or inefficient scientific knowledge transmission hindering effective upscaling of land restoration [(Marques et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU8020177). Risk aversion reinforces these cultural stabilizers, as farmers remain normally reluctant to abandon conventional practices if this means putting their production at risk, particularly when no other agricultural areas in their regions practice the proposed soil and crop management approaches [(Aldaz-Lusarreta et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-8-655-2022). Many farmers select and apply various farming system principles according to their own experience and conditions rather than adhering to strict sustainable management philosophies, requiring acceptance of plural farmer identities and finding space for farmers to exhibit a range of ways to be a "good" farmer [(Cicek et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-023-00926-4).

## Policy and Governance Factors

**Summary:** Current EU agricultural policies create dependency on subsidies for sustainable practices adoption while lacking effective coordination between top-down regulations and bottom-up farmer needs, resulting in controversial outcomes despite decades of implementation. (5 sources)

The Mediterranean agricultural system exhibits profound dependency on policy interventions, with agri-environmental subsidies serving as the primary driver for sustainable practice adoption. The system strongly depends on agri-environmental subsidies, as only 5% of land users implemented sustainable technologies like green manure voluntarily [(Marques et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU8020177). This dependency demonstrates that barriers to adoption are not biophysical but rather center on farmers' unwillingness to change traditional practices, while circumstances such as poverty, weak policies, or inefficient scientific knowledge transmission hinder effective upscaling of land restoration [(Marques et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU8020177). The European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) represents the primary policy framework promoting soil health restoration through measures like cover crop subsidies and cross-compliance requirements. The sustainable management of natural resources is one of the key aspects of the EU's CAP, including goals such as conservation of soils and biodiversity, with cover crops being promoted as one of the most effective measures to reduce soil erosion through subsidies and cross-compliance [(Carpio et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY10091412). However, current policy instruments show mixed results and controversial outcomes. Current instruments such as subsidies designed to reduce soil erosion and restore degraded soil remain controversial, as it is not clear if their application over decades has resulted in net benefits [(Leeuwen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2019.01.018). This uncertainty highlights fundamental gaps in policy effectiveness measurement and long-term impact assessment. The governance structure reveals a critical disconnect between policy design and implementation realities. To achieve large-scale implementation of sustainable solutions, traditional top-down policy making must be integrated with bottom-up identification of most urgent problems and feasible solutions [(Leeuwen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2019.01.018). This integration challenge reflects broader coordination failures across different governance levels. Northern Mediterranean countries face particular coordination challenges in developing coherent policy frameworks. Following the commitment of National Action Plans developed in Northern Mediterranean countries like Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Greece, there is evident need to coordinate regional, country and supra-national strategies for soil quality and sustainable development to reduce the "environmental divide" between critical and non-critical areas [(Gambella et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SOILSYSTEMS5010011). Single-target actions like giving economic subsidies to farmers adopting less intensive mechanization should be better connected with broader policies promoting rural development, such as supporting farms that adopt organic cultivation protocols [(Gambella et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SOILSYSTEMS5010011). Policy interventions must address the fundamental economic drivers of system change. The low profitability and competitiveness of agricultural productions serves as a major driver of traditional crop abandonment and rural depopulation, particularly affecting Mediterranean woody crops like olive, almond and citrus that face problems of relatively low productivity and profitability [(Calatrava et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11050821). However, social demand expressed through greater willingness to pay for food obtained through sustainable practices offers potential for increasing economic benefits of marginal areas [(Calatrava et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11050821) . The success of policy interventions ultimately depends on addressing knowledge gaps and providing adequate technical support. While stakeholders find identified low-impact farming practices as easy and not costly, results point to reduced knowledge of practical benefits and the need for improved technical advice to foster adoption [(Calatrava et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11050821). Successful upscaling requires external material and economic support combined with spread of success information at the local scale to demonstrate multidimensional benefits of sustainable land management [(Marques et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU8020177).

## Farmer Engagement, Networks, and Grassroots Dynamics

**Summary:** Successful farmer engagement requires co-creation processes that combine traditional knowledge with modern training, while grassroots movements like AlVelAl demonstrate how local farmer initiatives supported by broader networks can drive system transformation despite regional economic challenges. (4 sources)

Effective farmer engagement fundamentally depends on collaborative approaches that recognize farmers' central role in sustainable transformation. The successful implementation of nature-based solutions requires supportive policies and active engagement by stakeholders, including farmers, policymakers, and local communities, with farmers being essential since their traditional knowledge, combined with modern training, makes them vital in developing sustainable agricultural practices and addressing global soil and water challenges [(Netti et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-76346-5). The definition of the most suited management practices at the local level should be defined under a co-creation process considering the end-users' needs and constraints with the support of researchers and various implicated agents [(Lassaletta et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac002c). Grassroots movements demonstrate the potential for local farmer networks to drive broader system change. The AlVelAl initiative in southeast Spain exemplifies how farmer-led organizations can promote regenerative agriculture to restore natural, social, and financial capital while returning inspiration to rural communities [(Tittonell et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2022.844261). Created by local farmers with support from the Commonland foundation, regional governments, local businesses, and research institutions, this network operates in a region with approximately 50% unemployment among the active population and significant outmigration of young people contributing to aging and depopulation [(Tittonell et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2022.844261). These farmer networks can inspire broader community transformation by demonstrating integrated approaches that combine traditional and modern technologies. New sustainable farming approaches that integrate productive systems, such as combining almond orchards with sheep production using cover crops, inspire younger farmers to start businesses and form new communities of farmers who combine old and new technologies [(Keesstra et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/LAND7040133). This demonstrates how successful local examples can catalyze broader adoption when they provide both economic and environmental benefits. However, scaling grassroots initiatives requires recognition that local conditions significantly influence practice effectiveness. Agronomic practices like rainfed versus irrigated crops or soil characteristics such as acidic versus calcareous soils could limit the beneficial effects of sustainable practices successfully developed and implemented in other regions, and even prevent their implementation [(Lassaletta et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac002c). This suggests that farmer networks must adapt practices to local contexts rather than simply replicating successful models from elsewhere. The economic dimension of farmer engagement reveals both opportunities and challenges. Economic and social benefits from practices such as conservation agriculture and agroforestry can reduce input costs and improve crop yields, thereby providing financial incentives for farmers while enhancing food security and community resilience [(Netti et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-76346-5). However, the risk of co-optation by large corporations through "green-washing" without real system transformation remains a concern, as the large and multiple definitions of regenerative agriculture allow space for companies to market business activities without addressing social justice considerations [(Tittonell et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2022.844261).

## Requirements for Transition (Levers and Incentives)

**Summary:** Successful soil health restoration requires a combination of financial support, technical training, and co-creation processes that integrate top-down policies with bottom-up farmer needs, while addressing the fundamental challenge of low agricultural profitability through market-based incentives and improved technical assistance. (7 sources)

The transition to sustainable soil management requires a multi-layered approach that addresses both immediate economic needs and long-term system transformation. Financial support remains the primary catalyst, as only 5% of land users implement sustainable technologies like green manure voluntarily, with 95% requiring agri-environmental subsidies for adoption [(Marques et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU8020177). However, current subsidy instruments designed to reduce soil erosion and restore degraded soil remain controversial, as their application over decades has not clearly resulted in net benefits [(Leeuwen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2019.01.018). Successful upscaling requires voluntary adoption based on external material and economic support combined with spread of success information at local scale to demonstrate multidimensional benefits of sustainable land management [(Marques et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU8020177). This approach must integrate traditional top-down policy making with bottom-up identification of most urgent problems and feasible solutions to achieve large-scale implementation [(Leeuwen et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2019.01.018). Knowledge transfer and technical support represent critical transition requirements. While stakeholders find identified low-impact farming practices easy and not costly, results point to reduced knowledge of practical benefits and the need for improved technical advice to foster adoption [(Calatrava et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11050821). The definition of most suited management practices at the local level should occur through a co-creation process considering end-users' needs and constraints with support of researchers and various implicated agents [(Lassaletta et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac002c). Market-based incentives offer potential pathways to address fundamental economic barriers. Social demand expressed through greater willingness to pay for food obtained through sustainable practices can increase economic benefits of marginal areas [(Calatrava et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11050821) [(Vapa-Tankosic et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.22434/IFAMR2017.0068). This market premium becomes especially important given that low profitability and competitiveness of agricultural productions serves as a major driver of traditional crop abandonment and rural depopulation [(Calatrava et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/AGRONOMY11050821). The transition requires recognition of local adaptation needs, as agronomic practices and soil characteristics could limit beneficial effects of sustainable practices successfully developed in other regions and even prevent their implementation [(Lassaletta et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac002c). Strong financial support from European, national, and local policies becomes essential for farmers using sustainable management practices who produce positive services for society and the environment, particularly given that low selling prices represent the most pressing challenge [(Heider et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13165-023-00444-3). Economic and social benefits from practices such as conservation agriculture and agroforestry can reduce input costs and improve crop yields, providing financial incentives for farmers while enhancing food security and community resilience [(Netti et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-76346-5). These measures could transform productive landscapes from environmental impact drivers to environmental solution providers, requiring supportive policies and active engagement by stakeholders including farmers, policymakers, and local communities [(Netti et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-76346-5).
