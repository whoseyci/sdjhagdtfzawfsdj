## Background

**Summary:** The EU is developing comprehensive soil protection policies through multiple interconnected initiatives, with the Soil Monitoring Law being the first binding EU-wide soil regulation currently under legislative review. These efforts are closely tied to the Common Agricultural Policy reforms and broader environmental objectives under the European Green Deal. (7 sources)

The European Union has launched an ambitious framework for soil protection that represents a significant shift from previous fragmented approaches. After the withdrawal of a Thematic Strategy for soil protection in 2014, Member States have relied primarily on national regulations, creating a patchwork of different approaches across the EU [(Winkler et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.36253/bae-15466) [(Mantino, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.36253/bae-12364). This regulatory gap is now being addressed through multiple coordinated policy instruments. The EU Soil Strategy 2030, combined with the proposed Soil Monitoring and Resilience Directive and the EU Soil Observatory, forms a comprehensive three-part system that establishes the political framework, concrete measures, and monitoring capabilities needed for soil protection [(Martinho et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e34307) [(Arias-Navarro et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13423). The European Soil Observatory has been central to developing these policies, contributing intensively to the design and drafting of the Soil Monitoring Law proposal, which was adopted by the Commission in July 2023 [(Panagos et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13507). This soil protection framework is closely integrated with agricultural policy through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) 2023-2027, which emphasizes environmental performance and climate resilience. The CAP currently addresses soil health through direct payments for cross-compliance with Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAEC) and voluntary eco-schemes focused on soil degradation prevention and restoration [(Winkler et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.36253/bae-15466) [(Eichhorn et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2024.2364774). The European Soil Observatory has contributed performance indicators on soil erosion and soil organic carbon for the CAP's Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Framework [(Panagos et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13507). The Soil Monitoring Law, if implemented, will constitute the first binding instrument for soil regulation at the EU level and will require Member States to achieve responsive agri-environmental interventions within their national public policies [(Winkler et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.36253/bae-15466) [(Falconi et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1002/ieam.4991). The law aims to put the EU on a pathway to healthy soils by 2050 by gathering data on soil health, making it available to farmers and soil managers, and establishing sustainable soil management as the norm [(Panagos et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13507).

## Current Status of EU Soil Monitoring Law

**Summary:** The EU Soil Monitoring Law is currently in the legislative co-decision procedure after being adopted by the Commission in July 2023, with both the European Parliament and Council having advanced amendments in 2024. The law aims to establish the first EU-wide soil monitoring framework to achieve healthy soils by 2050. (4 sources)

The Soil Monitoring and Resilience Directive proposal was officially adopted by the European Commission in July 2023, marking a significant milestone as the first EU-wide binding soil regulation [(Panagos et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13507) [(Criscuoli et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13577). The directive is built on three main pillars: monitoring soil health, adopting sustainable soil management practices, and identifying contaminated sites, with the ambitious goal of having all soils in healthy condition by 2050 [(Veloso et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-025-13698-z). The legislative process is now actively progressing through the co-decision procedure, which requires negotiation and joint adoption by both the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament [(Robinson et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13570). Key developments in 2024 include the European Parliament resolution in April 2024 and the Council (Environment) approval of the general approach in June 2024, both of which have advanced amendments to the original Commission proposal [(Robinson et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13570). The European Soil Observatory continues to support ongoing discussions in the European Parliament's Committees and in the European Council, which have been led by the Spanish and Belgian presidencies [(Panagos et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13507). The first stage of implementation will focus on establishing a comprehensive soil monitoring framework and assessing soils throughout the EU [(Robinson et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13570). Under Article 4 of the proposal, Member States will be required to identify soil districts to organize the monitoring system, based on administrative borders or climate, soil type, and land use information [(Criscuoli et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13577). The law will gather data on soil health and make it available to farmers and other soil managers, while making sustainable soil management the norm across the EU [(Panagos et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13507).

## Member State Positions and Points of Contention

**Summary:** Member States show mixed positions on the Soil Monitoring Law, with those having existing monitoring systems preferring to maintain current procedures for economic reasons, while the proposal offers flexibility to adapt indicators to national conditions. Key challenges include harmonizing different assessment approaches and building stakeholder consensus across EU and national levels. (2 sources)

The Soil Monitoring Law proposal has been designed with built-in flexibility that appears to address Member State concerns about adapting to diverse national conditions. The directive includes a list of soil descriptors and soil health criteria to be measured and monitored by Member States while allowing flexibility to adapt to national or local conditions [(Martinho et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e34307). This flexibility may be well received by Member States since it opens the possibility of choosing indicators and considering thresholds adapted to national pedoclimatic conditions [(Martinho et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e34307). However, significant divisions exist based on existing national capabilities and preferences. Member States with long-standing soil monitoring systems prefer to keep existing procedures, both for economic reasons and to safeguard long-term datasets [(Panagos et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1002/gch2.202400336). This creates a fundamental tension between maintaining established national approaches and achieving EU-wide harmonization. The harmonization challenge represents one of the most significant points of contention. Differences in the approaches used to assess soils show the need for harmonization of methodologies and more collaboration between Member States and with the EU [(Martinho et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e34307). Before the Soil Monitoring Law proposal, there was a lack of agreement on what constitutes healthy soil and which indicators and thresholds should be used for each soil type, ecosystem, and climatic zone [(Panagos et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1002/gch2.202400336). The European Commission plans to support Member States by reinforcing the current EU sampling program LUCAS topsoil and extending LUCAS with increased sampling points to better monitor soils across the EU [(Panagos et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1002/gch2.202400336). The standardization and integration of national data with EU LUCAS soil data is expected to reduce administrative costs and burden for Member States to fulfill different reporting obligations related to LULUCF, Common Agricultural Policy, Nature Restoration Law, and other agro-environmental policies [(Panagos et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1002/gch2.202400336). The biggest challenge appears to be finding ways to bring various stakeholders into agreement at both national and EU levels to define an effective and consensual regulatory system for soils [(Martinho et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e34307). This suggests that technical disagreements about monitoring approaches may be secondary to broader political and economic concerns about implementation costs and regulatory burden.

## CAP Post-2027 Reform Timeline and Environmental Measures

**Summary:** The current CAP 2023-2027 emphasizes environmental performance and climate resilience with specific soil-related measures, while future reforms will need to integrate with the new Soil Monitoring Law and Carbon Removal Certification framework. Key environmental measures include performance indicators for soil erosion and soil organic carbon, with ongoing discussions about avoiding double funding conflicts between CAP payments and carbon credits. (5 sources)

The current Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) 2023-2027 represents a significant shift toward environmental performance and climate resilience, with direct implications for soil health management [(Panagos et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13507). The policy framework includes sustainable management of natural resources and climate action as core objectives, with specific focus on greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity, soil and water protection [(Panagos et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13507). The CAP's Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (PMEF) uses performance indicators that shift policy focus from compliance to results-based approaches [(Panagos et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13507). The European Soil Observatory has contributed evidence and performance indicators specifically on soil erosion and soil organic carbon for the CAP PMEF, establishing baseline monitoring capabilities for future policy development [(Panagos et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13507). Current soil-related environmental measures under the CAP include direct payments for cross-compliance with Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAEC) concerning soil cover and organic matter, and voluntary eco-schemes that address prevention of soil degradation, soil restoration, improvement of soil fertility and nutrient management [(Winkler et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.36253/bae-15466). The second pillar of CAP addresses soil health through Agri-Environmental-Climate Schemes (AECS) that target soil protection either directly or indirectly [(Winkler et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.36253/bae-15466) [(Mantino, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.36253/bae-12364) [(Eichhorn et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2024.2364774). Future CAP reforms will need to address integration challenges with emerging EU frameworks. The European Commission has adopted a proposal for the first EU-wide voluntary Carbon Removal Certification framework, which includes practices to enhance soil organic carbon stocks through crop rotation and reduced tillage [(Panagos et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13507). However, the framework does not yet clarify whether farmers could apply for carbon credits if they received CAP payments for the same measures, creating potential double funding issues [(Criscuoli et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13577). Recommendations for post-2027 CAP development include clarifying interactions with both the CAP and the Soil Monitoring Law, setting the GAECs of the CAP as a regulatory baseline monitored through existing Integrated Administration and Control Systems, and using LUCAS survey data for standardized baselines when national data are unavailable [(Criscuoli et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13577). The new monitoring system established by the Soil Monitoring Law will need to integrate with CAP monitoring systems to avoid duplicative reporting requirements [(Criscuoli et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13577).

## Policy Influence Opportunities

**Summary:** Key windows for policy influence include the ongoing co-decision procedure for the Soil Monitoring Law with Parliament and Council amendments progressing in 2024, and the pre-2027 discussions for CAP reform integration. The European Soil Observatory continues to provide technical support to both Parliament committees and Council presidencies during these critical negotiation phases. (2 sources)

The most immediate opportunity for policy influence lies in the active legislative co-decision procedure for the Soil Monitoring Law, where stakeholders can engage with ongoing negotiations between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament [(Robinson et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13570). The legislative process has already seen significant developments with the European Parliament resolution in April 2024 and the Council (Environment) approval of the general approach in June 2024, indicating that amendments to the original Commission proposal are being actively considered [(Robinson et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13570). Technical expertise and evidence-based input appear to have substantial influence during this process. The European Soil Observatory has demonstrated this through its intensive contribution to the design and drafting of the Soil Monitoring and Resilience Directive proposal and continues to support discussions in the European Parliament's Committees and in the European Council under the Spanish and Belgian presidencies [(Panagos et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13507). This suggests that technical organizations and research institutions have meaningful access to influence policy development. The pre-2027 period presents critical opportunities for shaping the integration between the Soil Monitoring Law and future CAP reforms. The current CAP 2023-2027 already emphasizes environmental performance and climate resilience, with the European Soil Observatory contributing evidence and performance indicators on soil erosion and soil organic carbon for the CAP's Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Framework [(Panagos et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13507). Stakeholders can leverage this foundation to influence how the new soil monitoring requirements will integrate with post-2027 agricultural policy. The development of the Carbon Removal Certification framework also creates a parallel policy influence opportunity, as the European Commission has adopted a proposal for the first EU-wide voluntary framework that includes practices to enhance soil organic carbon stocks [(Panagos et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13507). This framework will need to be coordinated with both the Soil Monitoring Law and future CAP reforms, creating multiple interconnected policy streams where coordinated influence efforts could be particularly effective.
