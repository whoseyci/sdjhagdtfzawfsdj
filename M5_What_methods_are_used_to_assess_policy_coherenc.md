**Research Query:** M.5 What methods are used to assess policy coherence and integration between agricultural and environmental policies?

---

## Introduction/Background

**Summary:** Policy coherence between agricultural and environmental policies involves aligning actions across sectors to meet shared objectives, requiring assessment of how well different policy areas work together rather than against each other. This process examines comprehensiveness, aggregation, and consistency across policy levels to minimize contradictions and create synergies. (5 sources)

Assessing policy coherence and integration between agricultural and environmental policies has become increasingly important as governments recognize the need for coordinated action across sectors. Policy coherence occurs when policy actions across sectors and stakeholders are actively aligned towards meeting agreed objectives [(Chevallier, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10220461.2024.2318712). This concept extends beyond simple coordination to encompass what scholars call "deliberate coordinated action by public, private and civic stakeholders for creating synergies across socio-economic and environmental areas" [(Berkum et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12571-021-01192-6). The assessment process itself involves multiple dimensions. According to established frameworks, policy integration consists of three consecutive stages: comprehensiveness in the input stage, which acknowledges the broader scope of policy consequences across different issues, actors, time and space; aggregation in the processing of inputs, which evaluates policy alternatives from an overall perspective; and consistency in outputs, which ensures different policy elements align across policy levels and government agencies [(Pramova et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.17528/CIFOR/005624). This framework relates closely to policy consistency - the degree to which contradictions between different aims and policy goals have been assessed and efforts made to minimize revealed contradictions [(Pramova et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.17528/CIFOR/005624). Environmental policy integration specifically focuses on "the incorporation of environmental objectives into all stages of policy making in non-environmental policy sectors, accompanied by an attempt to aggregate presumed environmental consequences into an overall evaluation of policy, and a commitment to minimize contradictions between environmental and sectoral policies" [(Rogge et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.RESPOL.2016.04.004). The practical challenges of this integration are evident in contexts like agricultural pollution control, where agricultural policy promoting productivity may conflict with environmental policy emphasizing resource conservation, creating significant institutional impediments [(Foster et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/w13172417).

## Conceptual Frameworks for Assessment

**Summary:** Researchers have developed several analytical frameworks to assess policy coherence, including multi-dimensional approaches that examine horizontal and vertical coherence, three-step processes analyzing objectives and instruments, and integrated frameworks that combine policy integration theory with sustainability transitions. (5 sources)

Several conceptual frameworks have emerged to systematically assess policy coherence and integration between agricultural and environmental policies. One widely used approach examines policy coherence across multiple dimensions, including horizontal policy coherence (working across agencies at the same scale) and vertical policy coherence (working across agencies at different scales), combined with programmatic alignment that considers strategic vision development, tactical institutional interactions, and operational implementation levels [(Singh et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.709947). A three-step analytical framework focuses on the interplay between policy objectives, instruments, and implementation, emphasizing the design of implementation conditions based on how objectives are arranged, instruments are allocated, and responsibilities are defined in policy documents [(Lindahl et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106617). This approach builds on earlier work that established consecutive stages of comprehensiveness, aggregation, and consistency, with particular attention to information and knowledge generation, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, stakeholder engagement, and adaptive management [(Pramova et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.17528/CIFOR/005624). More complex frameworks combine multiple theoretical perspectives to create comprehensive assessment tools. Researchers have developed approaches that synthesize Environmental Policy Integration concepts with Water-Energy-Land Nexus frameworks to analyze different dimensions of natural resource policy integration [(Venghaus et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/en12234446). Other frameworks distinguish between internal coherence within individual policy domains and cross-domain coherence, using climate change adaptation mainstreaming levels to define integration between different policy areas, while also assessing policy alignment through explicit references to shared mandates and goals across sectors like agriculture, nutrition, and disaster risk reduction [(Hidalgo et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2022.2095969).

## Qualitative Assessment Methods

**Summary:** Qualitative assessment methods for policy coherence include systematic document analysis with scoring criteria, structured questionnaires with expert opinions, thematic coding of policy measures, and mixed approaches combining content analysis with interviews or focus groups. (6 sources)

Several qualitative methods have been developed to assess policy coherence and integration between agricultural and environmental policies: • **Systematic Document Analysis with Scoring Criteria**: Researchers use structured approaches to analyze policy documents and assess coherence levels through standardized scoring systems. One method employs scoring criteria ranging from 0 (no coherence) to 3 (high coherence), where high coherence indicates substantial alignment with strategic objectives and detailed measures for advancement, while limited coherence shows only general acknowledgment without specific measures [(Kelleher et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su11247247). • **Expert Opinion Questionnaires**: Structured questionnaires collect expert opinions to evaluate policy implementation realities across multiple criteria including effectiveness of information exchange, coherence of requirements as perceived by stakeholders, relevance of implementation mechanisms, and added value of coordination between policy areas [(Campling et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142971). • **Thematic Coding and Content Analysis**: This approach involves extracting policy measures from documents and applying thematic coding to assess coherence. Researchers sample measures from international, national, and local level documents, then code them thematically before assessing coherence with specific objectives [(Onyango et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-024-02275-8). Software tools like NVivo, MaxQDA, and Atlas.it are commonly used to support code creation and analysis [(Monticone et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.36253/rea-14439). • **Interplay Analysis of Objectives and Instruments**: Some methods focus on analyzing policy documents to identify policy objectives and instruments, then assess coherence among objectives and between objectives and instruments using established methodological frameworks [(Papadopoulou et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12010373). • **Mixed Qualitative-Interview Approaches**: Studies combine qualitative document analysis with expert interviews, focus groups, and participant observations to provide multiple perspectives on policy coherence, often interpreted through specialized methodologies like Social Network Analysis [(Monticone et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.36253/rea-14439) [(England et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-018-1283-0).

## Quantitative and Mixed Methods

**Summary:** Quantitative and mixed methods for assessing policy coherence include network analysis to identify target clusters and ministry collaborations, regression analysis to test governance arrangements, Policy Coherence Matrix surveys with expert scoring, and Excel-based tools like the FABLE approach for integrating food policies with environmental standards. (3 sources)

• **Network Analysis Approaches**: Researchers use network analysis to identify clusters of highly interlinked targets and propose inter-ministry collaborations for enhancement of policy coherence within clusters [(Horan, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU12187800) [(Weitz et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-017-0470-0). This approach considers how targets interact with each other in networks to provide more robust priority setting for cross-sectoral collaboration between actors [(Weitz et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-017-0470-0). • **Regression Analysis of Governance Arrangements**: Statistical methods like regression analysis are used to test the impact of different types of governance arrangements on policy achievement outcomes [(Horan, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU12187800). • **Policy Coherence Matrix (PCM) with Expert Surveys**: This mixed-methods approach uses a structured table where the horizontal axis consists of policies being compared and the vertical axis contains reference policies for comparison, with resulting cells containing coherence scores. Online surveys distributed to experts score the effect of one policy domain on another, such as how waste, bio-based industry, environment, and renewable energy policies affect agro-food policy goals [(Monticone et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.36253/rea-14439). • **Combined Qualitative-Quantitative Content Analysis**: Studies combine quantitative content analysis of policy documents with qualitative analysis of interviews to assess policy integration, such as examining whether better integrated food security policies were developed after major events [(Monticone et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.36253/rea-14439). • **Social Network Analysis (SNA) for Interview Data**: Interview data is interpreted through Social Network Analysis methodology to understand policy coherence relationships and interactions [(Monticone et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.36253/rea-14439). • **Excel-Based Collaborative Tools**: The FABLE (Food, Agriculture, Biodiversity, Land, and Energy) approach represents a fully quantitative method using Excel-based tools developed collaboratively to better integrate food policies with environmental sustainability standards [(Monticone et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.36253/rea-14439).

## Specific Tools and Indicators

**Summary:** Specific tools for assessing policy coherence include agri-environmental indicators organized by scale (crop to regional level), sustainability assessment frameworks like SMART and TAPE, and comprehensive indicator systems like IRENA that monitor agricultural-environmental policy integration using standardized criteria. (6 sources)

• **Agri-environmental Indicators with Scale-based Approach**: These indicators assess and monitor agrosystem "health state" and changes induced by policy measures, designed for quick ex-ante and ex-post evaluation of environmental effects of agricultural policies. The scale approach starts from field-crop system level and progressively enlarges to farm, district, and regional levels to enhance quantitative data information content, analyze specific governance and policy interactions, and connect agri-environmental indicators to their most suitable dimension [(Salvan et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202112.0210.v1). • **Environmental and Sustainability Impact Assessments**: Environmental Impact Assessments and Sustainability Impact Assessments examine the impact of sectoral policies on environmental protection and sustainable development. These policy evaluation tools serve as potential drivers of policy integration by assessing coherence among policy interventions and identifying where expected synergies occurred or not [(Cejudo et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11077-022-09483-1) [(Sjoo et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/01442872.2021.2015312). • **Integrated Sustainability Assessment Tools**: Holistic impact evaluations combine different tools and data, including life-cycle assessment data, sustainability assessment tools such as SMART and TAPE, and environmental monitoring data. These strategies capture trade-offs and synergies between a range of sustainability outcomes [(Benni et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/qopen/qoad003) [(Mottet et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2020.579154). • **IRENA Indicator System**: The Indicator Reporting on the Integration of Environmental concerns into Agricultural policy (IRENA) initiative develops agri-environmental indicators for monitoring integration between agricultural and environmental policies. IRENA identified 35 detailed indicators subdivided into five groups, selected based on policy relevance, responsiveness, analytical soundness, data availability, ease of interpretation, and cost effectiveness [(Giupponi et al., 2006)](https://doi.org/10.4081/IJA.2006.647).

## Multi-level and Cross-sectoral Approaches

**Summary:** Multi-level and cross-sectoral approaches to assessing policy coherence involve coordinating governance across different sectors and scales, using tools like ecosystem-based management and nexus thinking to identify competing objectives and solutions. These approaches enable ex-ante policy evaluation and support mutual adaptation of instruments across government departments. (4 sources)

Assessment of policy coherence between agricultural and environmental policies increasingly requires multi-level and cross-sectoral approaches that coordinate governance across different sectors and scales. Cross-sector governance employs various tools and policy mechanisms, with approaches such as ecosystem-based management and spatial/land-use planning focusing on science-based integrated management with active local participation [(Chapman et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU9091594). Ecosystem-based management considers the interactive and cumulative effects that humans have on linked social and ecological systems, providing a comprehensive framework for assessing coherence across sectors [(Chapman et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU9091594). The nexus approach has emerged as a particularly valuable tool for multi-sectoral policy coherence assessment. Studies analyze coherence among the main goals of multiple policy areas such as water, energy, food, land, and climate through desk reviews, expert assessments, and stakeholder interactions, providing insights into the use of policy coherence analysis as an integral part of resource nexus assessments [(Blicharska et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1002/eet.2072). The ecosystem services nexus helps detect how missing coordination between policy sectors endangers sustainable development through competing objectives in land use and identifies solutions for achieving balance without jeopardizing ecosystem services and resource needs of future generations [(Furst et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21513732.2017.1396257). These multi-level approaches support both retrospective and prospective policy analysis. Nexus thinking can support ex-ante assessments of prospected changes in policies, plans and projects by examining response mechanisms in a manner that enables mutual co-adaptation of corresponding instruments and intervention alternatives [(Furst et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21513732.2017.1396257). Policy consistency analysis provides insights for ex-ante evaluation of coherence in policy mixes, with greater focus on harmonization, coordination, and cooperation of policy processes across government departments and agencies [(Lieu et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10061896).
