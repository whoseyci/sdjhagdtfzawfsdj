**Research Query:** 7.10 What role does collective action and cooperative management play in successful adoption of sustainable agricultural practices in Mediterranean regions?

---

## Introduction

**Summary:** Collective action and cooperative management are key tools for promoting sustainable agriculture in Mediterranean regions, helping farmers overcome challenges from globalization and environmental pressures. These approaches enable coordinated resource management, knowledge sharing, and stronger market connections that individual farmers cannot achieve alone. (5 sources)

Collective action and cooperative management play a crucial role in advancing sustainable agricultural practices across Mediterranean regions, particularly as rural communities face mounting pressures from globalization and environmental change. Research demonstrates that cooperative reliance among rural Mediterranean communities can serve as an effective strategy for long-term revitalization, with approaches including farmer cooperatives, controlled appellation systems, product traceability, and origin-based labeling helping to reestablish producer-consumer linkages while promoting ecologically sound land use practices [(Zaferatos, 2011)](https://doi.org/10.5539/JSD.V4N1P23). Agricultural policymakers increasingly recognize collective action as a powerful tool for achieving policy objectives, particularly in Europe where biodiversity protection and water management measures now include collective conditionality constraints that link funding eligibility to cooperation and coordination among farmers [(Zavalloni et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.833). Studies have shown that self-organized systems can successfully manage natural resources, with research identifying key design principles for effective cooperation, including the critical importance of equitable distribution of resources and benefits among participants [(Zavalloni et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.833) [(Cox et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03704-150438) [(Baggio et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.634). To boost agroecological transitions in Mediterranean Europe specifically, better networking and engagement of different actors within a coherent institutional framework supporting the transition is strongly needed [(Migliorini et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10082724). This collective approach not only promotes sustainable farming practices but also helps reestablish viable agrarian communities with diversified farming systems that experience reduced social vulnerability by emphasizing community well-being and resilience [(Zaferatos, 2011)](https://doi.org/10.5539/JSD.V4N1P23).

## Forms of Collective Action and Cooperative Management

**Summary:** Mediterranean regions use various forms of collective action including agricultural cooperatives, producer organizations, environmental cooperatives, water user associations, and quality certification schemes. These structures help farmers pool resources, share knowledge, access markets, and implement sustainable practices more effectively than individual efforts. (8 sources)

The Mediterranean agricultural sector employs several distinct forms of collective action and cooperative management to promote sustainable practices: • **Agricultural Cooperatives and Development Cooperatives**: Traditional farmer cooperatives that provide access to credits, land, productive seedlings, and extension services, with cooperative membership raising technical efficiency by 10.16 to 10.52 percentage points [(Kashiwagi, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.30682/NM2003B). In Turkey's Western Mediterranean Region, Agricultural Development Cooperatives serve 775,255 partners across 7,196 cooperatives, focusing on bringing rural resources to the economy and establishing agro-industrial processing facilities [(Kashiwagi, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.30682/NM2003B) [(Ozalp, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.30682/NM1902H). • **Producer Organizations (POs)**: Specialized entities that provide advisory services, research programmes, and agronomic events, with European support programmes enabling technical assistance delivery in regions like Crete [(Duvaleix et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122410457). These organizations serve as trusted sources of knowledge for farmer decision-making and can be organized into associations to increase efficiency and reduce costs. • **Environmental Cooperatives**: Collaborative structures that facilitate participation in agri-environmental schemes (AES) by sharing risks, costs, decision responsibilities, and objectives among participants while enabling mutual monitoring and knowledge sharing [(Olivieri et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13126936). These cooperatives help overcome information asymmetries and moral hazard problems through self-monitoring and reputation preservation mechanisms. • **Water User Associations**: Organizations that play major roles in production, distribution, and marketing under semi-arid Mediterranean climates, with cooperative participation significantly enhancing collective action for water-saving irrigation technology adoption [(Kashiwagi, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.30682/NM2003B) [(Zhu et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture14010096). • **Quality Certification and Collective Bargaining Systems**: Cooperative models that improve market access through collective bargaining, resource sharing, and technology integration, with 95.1% of Greek farmers agreeing that collective bargaining increases agricultural commodity prices [(Kalogiannidis et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su16167202). Quality labels incorporated into financial instruments serve as powerful tools for fostering sustainable development [(Duvaleix et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122410457). • **Technical Knowledge Networks**: Specialized cooperative structures where agricultural technicians form knowledge networks, meeting regularly to share information and seek solutions collectively, as demonstrated in Almeria's cooperative system that transformed from market-dominant logic to cooperation-based coordination mechanisms [(Giagnocavo et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su10072198). • **Hybrid Collective Arrangements**: Government-supported structures that promote self-organization through locally adapted rules, enabling shared responsibilities and participatory design of measures rather than leaving farmers to address ecosystem service provision individually [(Limbach, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2023.2174414).

## Benefits and Mechanisms of Collective Action

**Summary:** Collective action delivers concrete benefits including improved technical efficiency, better market access, and enhanced knowledge sharing, while creating mechanisms for risk sharing, resource pooling, and participatory decision-making that individual farmers cannot achieve alone. (13 sources)

Collective action and cooperative management create multiple pathways for enhancing sustainable agricultural adoption through both direct benefits and underlying mechanisms that address systemic barriers faced by individual farmers. **Technical and Economic Benefits**: Research demonstrates that cooperative membership produces measurable improvements in farm performance, with studies showing that joining cooperatives raises technical efficiency by 10.16 to 10.52 percentage points through improved access to credits, land, productive seedlings, and extension services [(Kashiwagi, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.30682/NM2003B). Agricultural cooperatives provide platforms for resource sharing among members, with 94.2% of farmers reporting increased farm productivity and sustainability, while 91.5% experience improved access to credit and financial support [(Kalogiannidis et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su16167202). Collective bargaining through cooperatives significantly enhances market power, with 95.1% of Greek farmers agreeing that this approach increases agricultural commodity prices [(Kalogiannidis et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su16167202). **Knowledge Creation and Technology Adoption**: Collective arrangements facilitate knowledge sharing and peer learning that accelerate sustainable practice adoption [(Gemtou et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su16072828). Farmer associations and organizations serve as key elements for horizontally spreading agroecological knowledge from farmer to farmer, favoring the transition of larger areas to agroecological systems through progressive introduction of practices that require agreements among different stakeholders [(Palomo-Campesino et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10124339). The participatory approach in defining practices increases farmer engagement and environmental awareness, while cooperative structures enable technical, organizational and social innovations that build new knowledge networks [(Magaudda et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12062301). **Risk Sharing and Social Capital Development**: Social trust within collective structures enables farmers to share resources, knowledge, and risks while facilitating access to credit and financing [(Ruslan et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.6007/ijarbss/v13-i6/16903) [(Luu, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.37801/ajad2020.17.1.7). Farmer groups provide collateral for loans and facilitate resource sharing, while kinship ties and trader networks increase social support and cooperation, leading to more effective collective action and enhanced bargaining power [(Ruslan et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.6007/ijarbss/v13-i6/16903) [(Luu, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.37801/ajad2020.17.1.7) [(Luu_1, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.7454/hubs.asia.1030320). **Mechanisms for Complex Practice Implementation**: Collective action enables implementation of sophisticated sustainable practices that require landscape-scale coordination, with cooperative decision making, institutional arrangements, and internal supervision mechanisms ensuring successful adoption of technologies like water-saving irrigation systems [(Zhu et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture14010096). Collective efforts prove particularly effective in mitigating labor-related concerns associated with agroecological techniques, with collaborative teamwork approaches alleviating implementation complexities [(Sauda et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.5897/jaerd2023.1385). **Endogenous Adaptation and Policy Effectiveness**: Collective action emerges organically because it addresses real needs, gains support from concerned communities, and sustains itself through demonstrated effectiveness, making it more successful than top-down approaches [(Soubry et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1002/pan3.10075). Success largely depends on internal agency within collaborative structures rather than external conditions, with collaboration performance requiring clear priority definition and internal factor management [(Velten et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01261-y). This creates opportunities for co-creation of soil management options aligned with environmental and socioeconomic realities through community engagement [(Cicek et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-023-00926-4).

## Knowledge Sharing and Social Learning

**Summary:** Knowledge sharing and social learning are fundamental mechanisms through which collective action promotes sustainable agriculture, creating farmer-to-farmer networks that spread agroecological practices horizontally and build locally adapted knowledge systems that are more effective than top-down approaches. (9 sources)

Knowledge sharing and social learning represent core mechanisms through which collective action transforms agricultural practice adoption in Mediterranean regions. These processes create dynamic learning environments where farmers progressively build capacity for implementing increasingly complex sustainable practices. **Horizontal Knowledge Transfer Networks**: Farmer associations and organizations serve as key elements for horizontally spreading agroecological knowledge from farmer to farmer, favoring the transition of larger areas to agroecological systems through progressive introduction of practices that require agreements among different stakeholders [(Palomo-Campesino et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10124339). In Mediterranean cooperative systems like Almeria, agricultural technicians form knowledge networks, meeting twice monthly to share information, flag dangers, and seek solutions together, with cooperatives playing an important role in defining and building the community rather than the reverse [(Giagnocavo et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su10072198) [(Giagnocavo, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12239820). **Knowledge-Based Sustainable Solutions**: The cooperative business model proves fundamental in finding more sustainable solutions, where many sustainable farming practices are more knowledge-based than product-based, including biological control to reduce pests and pesticides, improving soil by composting, and aggregating cooperative member farm data to improve decision making [(Giagnocavo, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12239820). These cooperative knowledge systems operate as non-profit extracting business models that emphasize benefits for farmers rather than cost reduction inherent in corporate models. **Peer-to-Peer Learning and Local Adaptation**: Through experience sharing, peer-to-peer farmer networks create knowledge bases that are results-based and adapted to local contexts [(Limbach, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2023.2174414). The mobilization of financial support for farmers' collectives and cooperative dynamics proves decisive in constructing agroecological knowledge for promoting sustainable practices, with collective knowledge rise spreading to realities outside the consortium and creating social capital important for improving whole rural areas [(Olivieri et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13126936). **Social Trust and Knowledge Exchange**: Social trust enables farmers to share resources and knowledge while facilitating collective advocacy for policies supporting sustainable agriculture practices [(Ruslan et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.6007/ijarbss/v13-i6/16903) [(Luu, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.37801/ajad2020.17.1.7) [(Luu_1, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.7454/hubs.asia.1030320). Farmer groups and associations provide platforms for sharing knowledge, experience, and best practices related to sustainable agriculture, with kinship ties and trader networks increasing social support and cooperation among farmers [(Ruslan et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.6007/ijarbss/v13-i6/16903) [(Luu, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.37801/ajad2020.17.1.7). **Continuous Learning and Adaptive Management**: Collective management strategies combined with constant flows of formal and informal knowledge and learning create key elements for addressing sustainability challenges and creating more prosperous rural areas [(Herrera-Reyes et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10061881). This common action occurs through planning social learning in organizations, retaining memory and continuity of actions through dialogue, teamwork, and community projects, with integrating expert and experienced knowledge being fundamental for moving toward sustainability.

## Policy Support and Institutional Framework

**Summary:** Effective policy frameworks increasingly recognize collective action as a powerful tool for achieving agricultural sustainability goals, with European policies linking funding eligibility to farmer cooperation and supporting producer organizations, environmental cooperatives, and participatory governance structures that enable bottom-up adaptation. (7 sources)

Policy support and institutional frameworks play a critical role in enabling and scaling collective action for sustainable agriculture, with policymakers increasingly recognizing the strategic value of cooperative approaches over individual farmer interventions. **Policy Evolution Toward Collective Conditionality**: Agricultural policymakers are increasingly interested in the potential use of collective action as an effective tool to reach policy objectives, with European measures addressing biodiversity protection and water management now including collective conditionality constraints that link eligibility for funding to the emergence of cooperation and coordination among farmers [(Zavalloni et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.833). This represents a fundamental shift from individual farmer-focused policies toward recognition that complex environmental challenges require coordinated responses. **Supporting Producer Organizations and Cooperatives**: Future policies should incorporate quality labels in the design of financial instruments, as they constitute a powerful tool in fostering sustainable development, while public support for producer organizations serves as an informed and trusted source of knowledge for farmer decision-making [(Duvaleix et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su122410457). Legal recognition and support for associations of producer organizations proves more efficient than scattered individual organizations in providing advisory services, favoring knowledge exchange and decreasing costs. **Hybrid Governance Arrangements**: Hybrid approaches enable governments to promote self-organization through establishment of new rules adapted to local collective action situations, creating shared responsibilities and participatory design of measures rather than leaving farmers alone to provide ecosystem services [(Limbach, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2023.2174414). The mobilization of financial support for farmers' collectives and cooperative dynamics proves decisive in constructing agroecological knowledge for promoting sustainable practices. **Community-Led Policy Implementation**: When community norms strongly influence farmer behavior, policymakers can initiate community-led programs that leverage peer influences to promote sustainable practices, including peer mentoring systems where experienced farmers share their practices and experiences, harnessing collective power to enhance acceptance and integration of sustainable practices within local farming communities [(Maltby, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0301881). **Participatory Governance and Stakeholder Ownership**: Participatory approaches and transdisciplinary tools prove essential for addressing sustainability challenges, with stakeholder ownership providing actionable insights and promoting context-specific solutions [(Malamataris et al., 2025)](https://doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2025.1469762). Clear water allocation rules coupled with strong institutions and technical capacity represent fundamental governance elements, with direct farmer involvement and transparency in decision-making processes contributing to better solutions while building ownership, fostering social learning, and strengthening community relations [(Antunes et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2017.1323542). **Bottom-Up Policy Effectiveness**: Collective action emerges because it is needed, gains adoption through willing community support, and sustains itself through demonstrated effectiveness, suggesting that building adaptation policy with practitioners' innate needs and expertise as a starting point, rather than top-down guidance, creates immediately effective programs that enhance adoption and free up capacity for longer-term goals [(Soubry et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1002/pan3.10075).

## Challenges and Success Factors

**Summary:** Success in collective action depends more on internal factors like clear priorities and farmer engagement than external conditions, though challenges include ensuring equitable benefit distribution, maintaining participation across diverse stakeholders, and building trust through transparent governance structures. (10 sources)

While collective action offers significant potential for advancing sustainable agriculture, its success depends on addressing key challenges and implementing critical success factors that enable effective cooperation among diverse stakeholders. **Internal Agency Over External Conditions**: Research demonstrates that collaboration success requires defining clear priorities, as different success criteria demand different sets of decisive factors, with internal factors controlled by collaborative groups proving more important than uncontrollable external conditions [(Velten et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01261-y). Rather than depending on external and predefined conditions, success largely depends on agency within the collaboratives, suggesting that collective action emerges because it is needed, gains adoption through willing community support, and sustains itself through demonstrated effectiveness [(Soubry et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1002/pan3.10075). **Design Principles and Equitable Distribution**: Studies on collective action have shown the possibility for self-organized systems to successfully manage natural resources, with research identifying key design principles for effective cooperation [(Zavalloni et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.833) [(Cox et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-03704-150438). Among the most critical findings is that the distribution of resources and benefits appears more relevant than previously thought, with congruence between local conditions and rules and proportionality between investment and extraction proving key for success independent from natural and human-made infrastructure [(Baggio et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.18352/IJC.634). **Participatory Governance and Transparency**: Clear and accepted water allocation rules, coupled with strong institutions and technical capacity represent fundamental governance elements, with direct farmer involvement and higher transparency in decision-making processes contributing to better solutions while building ownership, fostering social learning, and strengthening community relations [(Antunes et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2017.1323542). The participatory approach in defining practices increases farmer engagement and environmental awareness, with solid involvement of farmers in decision-making processes serving as a precondition for maintaining and correctly managing resources [(Magaudda et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12062301). **Risk Management and Social Capital Development**: Collective approaches help risk-averse farmers overcome doubts by sharing risks, costs, decision responsibilities, and objectives among participants while enabling knowledge sharing that improves overall agricultural practices [(Olivieri et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13126936). Information asymmetry problems can be partially solved through mutual monitoring between group participants, while moral hazard problems are addressed because farmers want to preserve their reputation in the group, creating self-monitoring systems that ensure compliance. **Continuous Learning and Adaptive Management**: Successful collective management requires constant flows of formal and informal knowledge and learning as key elements for addressing sustainability challenges and creating more prosperous rural areas [(Herrera-Reyes et al., 2018)](https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10061881). Common action occurs through planning social learning in organizations, retaining memory and continuity of actions through dialogue, teamwork, and community projects, with integrating expert and experienced knowledge being fundamental for moving toward sustainability. **Policy Integration Challenges**: Better knowledge of collective action and farmers' propensity to undertake such action proves useful for promoting long-term sustainable management of public goods, requiring political institutions to facilitate networking through agricultural policies that promote local production and sustainable management while addressing both low income and environmental issues characteristic of many Mediterranean areas (Cembalo et al., 2014).
